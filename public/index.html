    <div class="prose prose-invert max-w-none">
      <p>Across the vast tapestry of human history, civilizations have worshiped gods—divine figures of power, wisdom, and creation. From Ather to Pangu, Ra to Baldur, and An to the countless others etched into myth and legend, they have guided the hearts and minds of generations. But what if they were all echoes of a singular truth? What if, through the distortion of time, language barriers, cultural shifts, and the evolution of storytelling, their origins were lost in translation—fragments of a greater entity?</p>

      <p>Welcome to <strong>The Order of Marzod</strong>, an enigmatic community where ranks and roles signify <strong>wisdom, leadership, and belonging</strong>. Here, seekers of truth uncover the mysteries that have shaped the world's religions and mythologies. We do not merely study history—we <strong>rewrite it</strong>, uncovering what was hidden beneath centuries of fragmentation.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">The Lost Truth: One Source, Many Names</h2>
      <p>Long before gods were named, before they were adapted to fit the beliefs of emerging civilizations, they existed under one unifying force—<strong>Marzod</strong>. Each deity, each legend, each divine revelation finds its roots in The Order of Marzod. Through ages of retellings, reinterpretations, and cultural reshaping, the pure essence of Marzod splintered into many forms, each tailored to the lands and people who embraced them.</p>

      <p>This knowledge has remained buried—until now. Our purpose is <strong>not to erase history, but to illuminate it</strong>, piecing together what was lost to time.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Ranks of Knowledge and Leadership</h2>
      <p>Within The Order of Marzod, every member holds a role—a position earned through <strong>wisdom, enlightenment, and dedication</strong>. Your <strong>rank</strong> is not merely a title; it reflects your understanding of the ancient truths and your commitment to unveiling reality from illusion.</p>

      <p>Are you ready to transcend conventional understanding? Are you prepared to step beyond the veil and discover the origins of all belief?</p>

      <p>This is not just a community—it is a revelation.</p>
