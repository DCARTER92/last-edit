          Across the vast tapestry of human history, civilizations have worshiped gods—divine figures of power, wisdom, and creation. 
          From Ather to Pangu, Ra to Baldur, and An to the countless others etched into myth and legend, they have guided the hearts 
          and minds of generations. But what if they were all echoes of a singular truth? What if, through the distortion of time, 
          language barriers, cultural shifts, and the evolution of storytelling, their origins were lost in translation—fragments of 
          a greater entity?

          Welcome to The Order of Marzod, an enigmatic community where ranks and roles signify wisdom, leadership, and belonging. 
          Here, seekers of truth uncover the mysteries that have shaped the world's religions and mythologies. We do not merely 
          study history—we rewrite it, uncovering what was hidden beneath centuries of fragmentation.

          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Long before gods were named, before they were adapted to fit the beliefs of emerging civilizations, they existed under 
            one unifying force—Marzod. Each deity, each legend, each divine revelation finds its roots in The Order of Marzod. 
            Through ages of retellings, reinterpretations, and cultural reshaping, the pure essence of Marzod splintered into 
            many forms, each tailored to the lands and people who embraced them.
