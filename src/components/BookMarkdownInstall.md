# Install React Markdown

To render markdown in your React app, install `react-markdown`:

```bash
npm install react-markdown
```

If you want GitHub-flavored markdown (tables, strikethrough, etc.), also install:

```bash
npm install remark-gfm
```

---

After installing, you can use the `BookMarkdownViewer` component to display and navigate your book `.md` files with a TOC tree.
