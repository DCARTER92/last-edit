If you've read my broader work, you know that's not what I'm about. I'm fully on board with gods of all stripes, and I think most mythology has a basis in fact, but I also know for a fact that rulers love to hijack mythology and twist it to their purposes, and I know that interaction with the higher dimensions is really damn confusing, especially when you don't really have the words to describe what you're seeing or the science to have any context for it. I'll strip mythology down to its bones and throw most of it away, but that doesn't mean I don't respect the cultures and history, or think that the myth is worthless.</p> </li> <li> <p>Antisemitic, anti-Islamic, or anti-Christian.

My take on history is up for debate, and I don't even stick to that. I do some speculation on the early days of the Israelites and Levantine mythology that is not widely accepted anywhere, but it's rooted in what little historical fact there is, and extrapolated based on reading the Bible with a critical eye, an understanding of basic psychology, and a good sense of mythological pattern recognition. All I can guarantee you is that my theories show a cleaner, simpler, more believable version of history than the Bible, I've done whatever legwork is possible to verify my ideas, and I won't pass you any information I know isn't true. My accuracy and intelligence are both up for debate. My only hard facts, until we reach the Babylonian Captivity, are that Abraham was a popular figure of Levantine myth, the Israelites split from the Canaanites around 1200 BCE, and Joshua didn't conquer Canaan. Any more than that is just me telling you what I think.</p> </li> </ol> <p>All that in mind, let's hop to it.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_bible-analysis/#levant-prehistory-1200-bce","title":"Levant: Prehistory - 1200 BCE","text":"<p>To talk about the Jewish people, we first have to talk about the Canaanites, and to talk about the Canaanites, we'll have to talk about Abraham. See, Abraham was a popular mythical figure in the Levant, that's the Mediterranean's farthest east coast, for those who don't know, and how far inland it goes kind of depends on who you ask and what context they're using it in. Abraham could take anyone down, not by strength, but by outsmarting them, and everyone loved it. The most popular myth about him said he fathered Ishmael on some Northern Arabian goddess, probably Al-'Uzza, who the Egyptians syncretized with Hathor, and Ishmael was the father of lots of the Arabian tribes. The Canaanites were just not having it, and they invented Isaac, made Hathor an Egyptian slave of Abraham's, and made Ishmael illegitimate so Isaac, their forefather, was the true bloodline.</p> <p>But they didn't stop there. Later on, they absorbed a new bunch of people, and they were real pricks about it. See, these people insisted on worshipping only their crappy little storm god, wouldn't just worship El, Ba'al, and Asherah like normal people, and so the Canaanites called them the God-Strugglers, or Israelites, in their language. And to really make sure these people knew their place, they invented sons of Isaac, named Jacob and Esau. In the Canaanite version, Esau, the father of Canaan, was the firstborn, the heir, the great hunter, guy you'd like to have a beer with. Jacob, father of Israel, was a lying, scheming little stain who you don't want to have a beer with if you're female, because I guarantee he'll slip something in it while you're not looking. Jacob ran away from home because he couldn't stand being the secondborn, and when the world was done chewing him up and spitting him out, Esau graciously welcomed him back, so it was a happy ending all around.</p> <p>Not so much, it turns out. The Canaanites used this story to make the Israelites miserable, wouldn't even give their god a place in the temples, no statues, nothing. But the Israelites, like all oppressed and excluded people, said \"fine, we don't like you anyway,\" and turned that separation into their whole identity. Jacob's not a pathetic, backstabbing little prick, he's a scrappy go-getter who outsmarts everyone to become Isaac's heir. Yahweh is too holy to be depicted, we don't even want statues. We're the ones who drew this line between us, because Yahweh loves us the best and wants us to stay separated from the riffraff. You see this kind of coping mechanism in a lot of groups through history, because it works, it gives oppressed and miserable people a lens they can view the world through that makes things not look quite so bleak.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_bible-analysis/#judaism-1200-bce-0-ce","title":"Judaism: 1200 BCE - 0 CE","text":"<p>Things went on like that for a while, and the Israelites started to integrate into Canaanite society in spite of it all. They weren't nobility or anything, but they were successful, the Canaanite rulers listened to them because irrational hostility is really hard to keep up long term, and the Israelites worshipped a lot of Canaanite gods because it's really hard to live somewhere and exclude yourself from all their social events. Things were mostly going fine, until the Levites, one of the leading factions of the Israelites, made a move. We're not sure what it was, or why they did it, but we do know they pissed off the Canaanites of Schechem so bad all the Israelites had to pick up and leave, and they HATED the Levites for that, for generations after. There was a mutiny brewing, no doubt, and the Levites knew they had to act fast.</p> <p>So they went back to the old-fashioned values of henotheism (belief in all gods, worship of one), and suggested that all the Israelites do the same, although it's possible nobody heard their polite requests over the various sounds of the massacre. The Levites hit them with a surprise attack, started killing people until the rest were singing their hymns to the right God, and started running the nationalist playbook, they established an \"other\" to blame all the problems on, and a reason to follow strict authoritarian laws built on purity and xenophobia. You don't want to be one of THEM, do you? Best follow our laws, then. They even wrote the Book of Joshua, which is fanfiction about the genocide they wished they had the military strength to pull off, and by all archaeological records categorically did not happen. Before you get the wrong idea, though, the attitudes and methods on display here were extremely common in the Bronze Age, the Levites are no worse than most other regimes of that time and level of cultural advancement. It's just that most cultures didn't write a 1,000-chapter book about it, so this is the only one we can talk about with accuracy.</p> <p>Things kind of calmed down for a while after the coup. The crisis passed, the Levites cleaned off their swords, a few tribes broke off, but most of them stayed, and the Israelite people were a kingdom just like any other, had about average success in both trade and war. Then Babylon came along, and being frustrated that they couldn't kick Egypt's ass, settled for Jerusalem instead, sacked the city in 587 BCE, burned the temple, and took their leaders hostage, moving them to Babylon. That's where they met the Zoroastrians, and they absorbed ideas about Heaven, Hell, and monotheism, among other things. And now that eating shellfish was punishable by eternal torture, the good old Levite Purity Code was more important than ever, because can you really afford to screw around with the flames of Hell? So these new Zoroastrian Jews, the Pharisees, built a fence around the Torah, making sure nobody ever brushed up against sin unless they broke five laws to get there, and while I'm sure they had the best intentions, it created a situation where the nationalism and authoritarianism of the Levites was always applied in the strictest possible sense, and it was making everyone miserable.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_bible-analysis/#christianity-0-ce","title":"Christianity: 0 CE","text":"<p>Not too surprising, then, that Jesus came along and told them they were being ridiculous, you don't need all those laws, you just need love of God and others.

But his message was spread, and the common people really liked the whole peace and love, egalitarian vibe to it, and when it finally got loud enough for the Roman Empire to hear it, they looked at the Levite authoritarianism backing it and said \"yeah, we can work with this.\" Rome and its descendants really liked the xenophobia and genocide, and used Jesus to open the door to people's hearts, knowing they'd let the Levites in too, kind of like when you're hitchhiking and you hide while your girlfriend stands there with her thumb out, and when somebody stops she says \"thanks so much! Can he come too?\" So Europe got to use salvation and purity as the base to launch crusades, inquisitions, and later, colonialism and the slave trade, because nationalist propaganda really is the best.

He went forward with the entirely valid and correct assumption that the Torah had been hijacked by evil pricks with hidden agendas, and while I don't necessarily agree with all of his final product, he did his best to straighten things up, smooth out contradictions, and emphasize peace and love above all. The Muslim Caliphates, much like Rome, saw that people really liked that message, peeled back the wallpaper, saw the Levite stuff underneath, nodded enthusiastically and smiled real wide, because hey, this house has good bones after all! That was the end of the Islamic Golden Age. Hey, you ever notice how when the Levites give a powerful culture an excuse to be pricks, that culture goes right into its Dark Ages almost immediately?

But, again, this is not a call to oppress or mistreat anybody. Even a good half of the most Orthodox Jews you can find will reject Zionism, loudly and enthusiastically till they're blue in the face, and most Jews aren't even close to Orthodox. Most Christians and Muslims believe in peace and harmony. All I'm saying is cut out the \"divinely inspired and always right word of God\" crap, because when you say that, you're saying the Levites, with all their hate, control, and regressive, harmful mentalities, have a pretty good point.

He's not exactly the strongest, but he's wily, like a Semetic Odysseus. He goes around making deals with djinn and making them regret it, where a normal person gets taken to the cleaners, he's screwing goddesses, getting rich, kicking ass, taking names. Everyone loves him. Everyone says he's the father of their culture, and the strongest claim, the most widespread story, is in Arabia, where they say Abraham fathered Ishmael on their mother goddess, who the Egyptians call Hathor.</p> <p>The Canaanites don't like that. They love Abraham too, and won't let the Arabs have him. Ishmael can't be denied outright, the myth is too strong, so they invent this other son of Abraham, Isaac, and tweak details around until Ishmael is illegitimate and Hathor is a slave named Hagar. But, because the Canaanites have another culture living with them, they also have to give Isaac two sons, one of whom has the true bloodline, the other with no standing for Abraham's inheritance. Esau is the older brother, great hunter, a man's man, and Jacob is the younger brother, kind of a squirrelly, quiet guy, and of course Esau is the heir. The myth seems to have been a Prodigal Son thing, where Jacob can't stand being second rate and runs off, and when he comes crawling back, Esau graciously takes him back into the family. Later, the Canaanites want to stop squabbling over mythology with the Arabians, so they have Esau marry into one of their prominent lines so everybody can be heirs of Abraham and get back to trading with each other.</p> <p>This other culture, the descendants of Jacob, are called Israelites because they struggle against the gods of Canaan, that's the meaning of the word in their language. Can hardly blame them, if I were permanently relegated to being a second class citizen because of Canaanite bedtime stories, I may not like them much either. These people really, really like this minor storm god of their ancestors, the one they had before the Canaanites absorbed them, and while they'll have some limited interaction with the other gods, it's mostly all Yahweh, all the time, and he's not given much of a place in the Canaanite Pantheon because that's the god of the peasants. These people absorb a lot of Canaanite mythology, too, including the story of Jacob and Esau, but they tweak these stories to make them about the Israelites. Esau sold his birthright, you see, so Jacob is the true heir. God came down for a wrestling match one night, that's why Jacob is called Israel.</p> <p>But it's the social status situation that's important. If history shows us anything, it's that the people on the bottom of the wheel don't enjoy it, and they'll do their best to spin it and try for a better spot, so there's a lot of backroom meetings and talk of social reform, and overall it's just a really great revolution that makes excellent progress, the Israelites are starting to be SOMEBODY. Their status is rising so much, in fact, that in the city of Schechem, an Israelite girl catches the eye of a Canaanite noble, and he doesn't see it as a stain on his honor to pursue her. We're not sure how far it went, or the exact circumstances, or whether it was consensual, but the upshot is her Israelite family, led by the Simeonites and Levites, are outraged, this just will not stand. But they're sneaky, they tell this nobleman it's fine, it's okay, he just has to accept their traditions, probably get circumcised, fit in enough that a marriage can take place to save Israelite honor. The nobleman agrees, they have a wedding, and then they make their woman a widow real quick, because that's how you preserve family honor, baby. And besides, they may only be Israelites, but after all these generations, isn't the top rung of Israelite society at least equal to the bottom rung of Canaanite nobility, able to uphold their family's honor?</p> <p>\"Ha, no,\" say the Canaanites of Schechem. There's a brutal crackdown, revenge killings, imprisonments, and the upshot is that the Levites have made it impossible to live in Schechem, and the Israelites will not be forgetting it anytime soon. Life in Schechem was fine, we were getting somewhere, and these pricks screwed the whole thing up for reasons that have nothing to do with the rest of us. They flee the city and live as nomads and herders for a good long while afterward.

As explained in the Book of Fire, this form of linking is very dangerous, and should not be attempted by those of insufficient experience.

The more fundamental the differences between the personalities, the less likely is success to be found. It cannot be overemphasized that caution must be exercised in this endeavor.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-air/#the-soul","title":"The Soul","text":"<p>On the subject of the soul and its composite parts, much has been written, but as certainty is difficult, as in all topics regarding the higher planes, disagreements abound. Regardless, it seems clear that there exist three main categories of soul parts, those being the Volus, or the distinct personality, the mind; the Anima, or the shared instincts, vitality, and subconscious knowledge of species, tied to body; the Umbra, the mingling of the two, and the medium through which they communicate both with each other and the Universe. The individual, then, should be imagined as being a wave with two peaks, the Volus and Anima, joining together at the Umbra, which connects to the cosmic ocean. These three parts contain their own composites, listed below.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-air/#volus","title":"Volus","text":"<ul> <li>Memory: The recorded experience of one's life</li> <li>Thought: Reason and deliberation</li> <li>Will: Conclusions reached by Thought and Memory and determination to act accordingly</li> </ul>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-air/#anima","title":"Anima","text":"<ul> <li>Life Force: The energy which makes living things alive</li> <li>Instinct: The pool of knowledge passed through genetic memory, chiefly dealing in preservation and continuation of Life Force</li> <li>Reflex: Action without thought, based purely in Instinct and without conscious volition</li> </ul>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-air/#umbra","title":"Umbra","text":"<ul> <li>Impression: Inward or outward changes based on exchange of information or action with the outside world</li> <li>Personality: The emergent combination of Volus and Anima, the image one sees of oneself</li> <li>Appearance: The combination of Anima's inevitabilities filtered through Volus's choices, the way one chooses to present oneself, often differing from Personality to a great or small degree</li> </ul> <p>Balance of the three parts is of great importance. Those who overindulge the Volus risk deterioration of the body and isolation from others, its focus being inward. Overindulgence of Anima results in losing oneself to hedonism. The Umbra contributes little of its own substance, and relies upon Volus and Anima to give it shape and meaning. A balanced soul develops both body and mind, and its communication carries great weight, while an unbalanced soul is prey to poor health, addiction, and isolation.</p> <p>While the body maintains partial separation between spirits, we know the body remains only a short time. After death, the Anima rejoins the ocean, being indistinct from all other Anima of the body's species. The Volus, if it is strong, continues its journey in the higher planes, of which we know little. Strength of Volus is seen in an individual's ability in life to resist the demands of their Anima, do what is wise and fulfilling rather than seeking shallow pleasure, and the Volus is strengthened by every act of coherent will, especially those which override the momentary cravings of Anima. A weak and underdeveloped Volus lacks the constitution to maintain its form, and so will dissipate once freed of the body's containment. However, the reader should note that this is an issue of coherence, not of morality. A person who chooses not to develop their Volus contributes all the more to the collective knowledge of Anima, by example of poor strategy if nothing else, and is not objectively better or worse for it.</p> <p>The chief danger of a weak Volus is in possession. While most Spirits are indifferent and many are benevolent, a malevolent entity, here called a Demon for the sake of brevity, may see a comparatively strong Anima as an opportunity. Spirits link to each other through similarity, and the Anima being indistinct, the Demon may easily attach to it, and finding it stronger than the Volus of the individual, control them. For those Practitioners who seek to communicate with Spirits, then, development of Volus is of paramount importance. This has been achieved in monastic traditions throughout history by discomfort without damage. Vows of silence and celibacy, fasting, bathing in ice, walking on coals, any action which requires suppression of Anima prepares the Practitioner for Spirits who may use it to control. The novice, however, is advised to begin with more modest steps, just as an infant does not learn to walk by undertaking a journey of fifty miles.</p> <p>The third part of the soul, the Umbra, is the thing referenced in talk of spirits who roam the Earth. It is an echo, an imprint which recalls the influence of Anima and Volus, and continues to feel those influences in the same way an amputee may feel phantom pains in their missing limb. It is often anchored to familiar matter, such as its remains, a valued object, or familiar geography. The Umbra, with no body, is unable to interact with matter, but attracts all types of energy, which it may discharge at will. While an overabundance of energy disrupts the Umbra, it can build a tolerance over decades, and in centuries or millenia, may rise to become a god. However, most Umbra who attempt this end in failure, taking in too much energy and dissolving themselves, and the Umbra who make no attempt to gain energy are doomed to fade to nothing within a few centuries. The Umbra has a lifespan as surely as does the body which precedes it, and only through great skill or fortune may death be cheated in either case.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-air/#the-marzodian-star","title":"The Marzodian Star","text":"<p>The Star protects any within from all harm by spirits, allowing communication with malevolent entities without danger to the Practitioner. The Star prevents a spiritual link from one without to one within, and vice versa, and its purpose is to contact, from a position of safety, entities who possess the ability to manifest in our plane, to gain familiarity before further contact. For precaution, any unfamiliar entity should be viewed as potentially hostile, though its actions and words may be nothing short of angelic, for evil entities often cloak their deeper intentions behind virtue. Above all things, the unbroken lines of the Star must not be crossed, or it shall be profaned, its protection forfeit. The breaking of a single line is sufficient, and any of the lines may then be crossed to enter or exit the circle. The cross, drawn with ash or dust, may be crossed at any time, so long as it is undisturbed. Should the Star be profaned, all its materials are rendered unsuitable for the task, they must be removed and the area cleansed before the Star may be rebuilt from new materials. Beware the trickery of evil spirits, who through intimidation or guile may seek to manipulate the Practitioner into profaning the Star, forfeiting its protection.</p> <p>The material of the Star is largely irrelevant, provided the material is all the same, but for convenience should be constructed in a way as to remain reliably, but be easily broken upon completion of the work. Large stones or timbers, though not so large as to prohibit their movement, are recommended for this purpose. If constraints of space prohibit the construction of the Star in its entirety, measuring 54 feet and one half inch, it is sufficient to construct only the 14-foot Cross, or it may be reduced to 7 feet by halving all dimensions. By the Cross, it is meant the circle within square within diamond, quartered by a cross. The Cross alone is not as strong as the full Star, particularly if reduced, and care should be taken not to attract spirits possessing both great power and poor disposition.</p> <p>Begin with a circle measuring seven feet across. Encase it in a square, each of its sides likewise measuring seven feet, with its sides oriented to the four cardinal directions. Encase the square in a diamond whose sides measure 9 feet, 10.5 inches and are touched at the midpoint by the corners of the square, the points of the diamond aligning with the four cardinal directions. In this way, a circle is nested within a square within a diamond, and they join lines at certain points described above. Draw a cross with ash or dust, its ends meeting the points of the diamond and crossing in the center of the circle.</p> <p>Go now from the center of the circle, measure from it 27 feet, 10 inches, to a point directly East. Do the same for the North, then the South, then the West, then place two points between each, the distance between each point measuring 14 feet, 5 inches, and all of equal distance from the center. The point in the East is the first point, the other eleven increase moving to the right from the inside of the circle.</p> <p>Now, from the eighth point, draw a line to the first, and continue to do so for all points, subtracting seven from the number of the end point to determine its point of origin. This is the method of the Marzodian Star, or the 12-7 dodecagram. As you see, the circle in the beginning beginning is seven feet in diameter, which is the number of Marzod, the diamond is fourteen, seven's double, and the final shape is the seven multiplied times 7.7, making this shape most significant.</p> <p>As a final step, Wood, Metal, Water, Fire shall be dedicated to East, North, West, South, with the primary powers, the planets, being set upon the cardinal directions, and their servants, or metals, being beside them, either to the right or left as space allows.

This is the case in dealing with the vast majority of spirits, and the problem may ordinarily be resolved by establishment of a spiritual link. However, if the Practitioner feels such a link may be dangerous, or the likelihood of success is low, other methods may be employed. In general, these methods ask that a spirit use its power to influence outcomes among a group of options whose likelihood is in normal cases equal. This task is generally within the power of any spirit, regardless of strength, and Numerology is among the most common methods to interpret the answer.</p> <p>The simplest method is the Casting of Coins. The coins should ideally be made of Electrum Magicum, though any may be used. Indeed, coins are not strictly necessary at all, as any object which gives an equal chance of two possible answers is perfectly acceptable, though generally coins are the easiest to procure in most circumstances. Describe the situation or question to the planets, then take any number of coins and cast them upon a surface, and count the ones which fall face upward. Numerology may be used then to determine which element offers a solution or answer.</p> <p>Divination by a 52-card deck of playing cards is somewhat more difficult. The system of Numerology is employed upon cards A-10, and the court cards are charged in advance with elemental energy, by keeping certain cards separate among herbs or animal parts which resonate with the energy of the element required. The Queens of Spades and Clubs should be charged by Water, the Queens of Hearts and Diamonds by Fire, the King and Jack of Spades by Wood, the King and Jack of Hearts by Earth, the King and Jack of Clubs by Air, the King and Jack of Diamonds by Metal. Or, perhaps more easily recalled, the Queen and Duchess are the highest ranking Queen cards, their servants are the lower Queens, the Kings represent the Duke, Marquis, Earl, and Count, and the Jacks their servants. A deck without the court cards may be employed without prior preparation.</p> <p>The cards are spread upon a surface, the Querent poses a question to the spirits, considers the cards carefully, and chooses. The spirit may choose to announce itself by inducing the Querent to draw a court card, or may remain anonymous and only answer the question by producing a card Ace through Ten, whose meaning the Practitioner should then attempt to divine though Numerology. If a court card is drawn more than once during the session, a new spirit has announced its participation. The answer may come from any spirit, announced or not. The value of cards Ace through Ten is determined by adding its face value to the value of its suit, so that the Six of Spades is ten, the Two of Diamonds is three, the Seven of Clubs is nine, and so on.</p> <p>However, all methods do not require Numerology. By observing a candle flame or pendulum, answers may be gleaned, although the Practitioner should be wary of chance gusts of air, which may distort the readings. And in all cases, let the Practitioner beware of information of the future. Time is not organized neatly in the spiritual plane, and any spirit may be mistaken, in particular those possessing little power. Also, as always, spirits may choose to mislead the Querent for purposes of amusement or gain.

Sprinkle herbs or other effects, burn incense, and put offerings into a bowl, plate, or glass, on the opposite side of the candle. Meditate upon the intention of the ritual. The colors of cloth, candle, and other effects, the type of herbs and incense, and the content of the offering are all dependent upon the intention of the ritual or the entity meant to be honored by it. Generally these items are easily decided if the target is clear.</p> <p>In general, the purpose of any daily ritual involving a spirit is to keep the entity in mind and to foster a sense of familiarity and connection. In the practices of many cultures, the entity is not invoked at all in these situations, but the devotee being convinced of the personal connection, the link is more easily forged at need. The problem arises when the devotee, ignorant of methods of actually invoking a spirit, believes the spirit of their choice is watching them at every moment, quick to act upon any errant thought of the devotee. This is not the case, and leads to coincidence as the driving force of faith, which fosters ineffective invocations, and the cycle continues. An invocation requires deep focus, and often the manipulation of light, heat, or sound in ways proven to appeal to certain types of spirit, cause certain recognizable effects in the higher plane. A passing thought in a disorganized mind will be of little effect, if any.</p> <p>To strengthen the link with a Spirit, some Practitioners choose to leave a sympathetic token at a gravesite or place the Spirit frequents. This is inadvisable for several reasons, chiefly that granting a Spirit unlimited access to oneself is an invitation to unwanted intrusion, but also this token may be stolen by a rival Practitioner and put to ill use. However, the arrangement offers obvious benefits as well, provided the Spirit has shown itself to be trustworthy and honorable, and boundaries are agreed upon.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-air/#conjunction-of-souls","title":"Conjunction of Souls","text":"<p>The conjunction of souls is of great importance for any work whose requirements exceed the strength of the lone Practitioner.

Prometheus","text":"<p>If you don't know who Prometheus is, well, I don't believe you, but okay. Let me tell you the story of the Greek god who by all rights should be the major deity of modern times, because he exemplifies the high points of Western morality, perfectly balancing individualism with societal obligation. But before I tell you about Prometheus, I need to tell you about the Titans, the Greek gods before the Greek gods.</p> <p>The Titans were led by Cronus, who was the son of Ouranos, the primordial deity of the sky. Cronus overthrew his father and was the big man in charge for a while, and when Ouranos told him he'd one day be overthrown by his son just as he'd done to his father, he decided he wasn't having that and ate his children as they were born. Rhea, his sister and wife, was perhaps understandably upset by this, and when she had a sixth child, she gave Cronus a rock to eat instead. I always wondered whether Cronos had questions afterward regarding the texture and taste of this most recent child, but the myth doesn't mention it, so I'm left with no answers. This sixth child was Zeus, who, sure enough, led a rebellion against Cronus and overthrew him, then locked him up in Tartarus. You have to wonder, would Zeus have even felt the need to do that if Cronus hadn't been an infanticidal, cannibalistic douchebag? Seems like Cronos should have looked inward for the source of his problems, and I'm not talking about the five gods in his belly.</p> <p>But the thing about this story is Prometheus was a part of Zeus's rebellion. He was one of the Titans, and then joined Zeus's bunch, the Olympians, and overthrew Cronus. This will be important later. For now, just know that, by some accounts, Prometheus came down to Earth after the war and made humans out of clay. You know how it is, you have a stressful day, you need to unwind, so you create a sentient race. Everybody needs a hobby.</p> <p>By other accounts, all the animals, including humans, just kind of existed, and Prometheus and his brother, Epimetheus, were given the job of handing out different qualities to them. Epimetheus handed out hearing, sight, smell, fur, strength, was very open-handed, and when he came to the last animal on the list, humans, his bag of tricks was empty. Prometheus said no problem, let's give them intelligence and call it a day, and that was that. No matter how you slice it, Prometheus was the reason humans are different from other animals. And he didn't stop helping us there.</p> <p>Zeus decided if there were going to be intelligent animals, he needed to get something out of it. It's not really detailed why he felt entitled to a slice of our cake, but he sure did, and demanded sacrifices. Prometheus had our backs again, though. He stuffed all the good parts of a bull into the stomach, made it look like a pile of guts, then took all the bones and covered them in fat. Then he went and got Zeus, and he told him he'd made two piles of animal parts, and all Zeus had to do was decide which pile he wanted to be his forever, out of every sacrifice. Zeus chose the pile of bones and fat, and Prometheus found some urgent business a long way off pretty quick, before Zeus figured out he'd been tricked. This was the beginning of Prometheus's quick slide down the crapper.</p> <p>See, Zeus didn't like that Prometheus had just made him look like an idiot. He decided he'd do something petty and spiteful, because I guess he thought he came out of that not looking quite bad enough, so he took away humanity's ability to make fire. It's not stated exactly how that worked, just that it happened. Well, Prometheus came to the rescue again, of course, he brought us fire back from Mount Olympus, and in some tellings he brought agriculture, science, math, medicine, just about everything we ever needed, really. It was a very nice gesture, all in all, so it kind of sucked that Zeus decided the appropriate reaction was to chain Prometheus up in the Caucasus Mountains and have an eagle come by to rip his liver out every day. Whatever you do, do not piss off Zeus. God of Justice my ass, he was a real prick.</p> <p>Now, Heracles eventually came and cut him loose, and then Prometheus told Zeus there was a prophecy about one of Zeus's sons overthrowing him, which is really a weird family tradition. The ancient Greeks really had a thing about sons overthrowing fathers, that and incest, they just couldn't get enough. Zeus figured, between the centuries of torture and the heads-up about the impending patricide, they were square, and didn't do anything else to him. Prometheus, for his part, didn't create any more sentient species or trick Zeus into eating offal again, so it was all fine. Don't you just love happy endings?</p> <p>1: Rebel When You're Right - 3-3 Prometheus rebelled against both Cronus and Zeus, he's quite possibly the only figure in the mythology of any culture who ever rebelled against two distinct divine regimes, he's the poster child for individuality and free thinking. But it's important to note he wasn't just a rebel because he had too big an ego to fall in line, or because he wanted to be cool and edgy. He saved his bucking the system for important stuff, like when the King started eating babies, or when the other King started arbitrarily punishing lesser creatures to show everybody what a big badass he was. It was his willingness to rebel against corrupt authority that defined him, but he had no problem with Zeus's authority when Cronus needed to be taken down.</p> <p>2: No Dragons - 3/3 While it's not in the story, I can't see Prometheus creating or allowing barriers that don't have a good basis in fact.</p> <p>3: Think it Through - 1/3 Lots of people want to change the world, but the world likes itself very much just the way it is, thank you, and if you go stepping on toes, eventually the owner of the toes will make you wish you hadn't. You need a plan, you can't just charge in. That's where Prometheus failed. His heart was in the right place, but his head wasn't, and soon after that, his liver wasn't, every day, for centuries. Don't let it happen to you.</p> <p>4: The Mesopotamian Method 3/3 Prometheus had every chance to just hang out on Mount Olympus and try to hook up with Aphrodite like all his friends, but instead he helped humans. And later on, even Zeus was glad he did, because it turned out Gaia, the Earth, created the Giants, a race that the gods couldn't kill, and they needed humans to do it for them in the Gigantomachy. Can you imagine the side-eyeing Zeus would catch from the other Olympians if that had come up after he kept humans from having fire for centuries? Hermes would be sitting over there like \"oh, hey, no problem, gods can't kill Giants, but humans can! I'll just run down and ask one, \"they love us, they really enjoy those cold nights without fire after SOMEONE TOOK IT FROM THEM.\" Then Zeus would make him Prometheus's cellmate, but all the other gods would still be thinking the same thing.</p> <p>But seriously, this is exactly why you need to elevate others. You can't do everything, and maybe there's no big problem right now, but one day there will be, and also, what are you talking about? There's millions of problems right now, do you live under a rock? And it's perfectly fine to be strong and smart and capable, but 90% of everything is being in the right place at the right time, and the other 10% is having the right help, so solving problems comes down to making sure there are as many strong, smart, capable people as possible. Mathematically speaking, the greater number of people are capable of solving a problem, the greater the chance that one of them will be in the right position to do it. By elevating as many people as you possibly can, you raise the odds of problems being solved, even if you don't solve them yourself. If you think it's not worth anything if you don't get the spotlight, do me a favor and hit yourself in the face with something really heavy.</p> <p>Total: 10/12 Prometheus is perfect in intent, just short on long-term planning. Honestly, if you're going to be like anybody, be like Prometheus.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-earth/#ii-lucifer","title":"II. Lucifer","text":"<p>In a book on rebellious deities, leaving out the most famous one would just be weird. Would it surprise you at all to know Satan isn't evil? At least, not originally, not in the Bible, but we'll go into the Quran and classical literature after we've got that cleared up. Biblically, Satan may even be a nice guy. We don't know, because he's Heaven's District Attorney, and we only ever see him doing his job. In the original texts, Satan is almost definitely an Angel, and just as good and loyal as Gabriel, Michael, or any of the others, but God's put him in a role that invites hate. Let's explore the big steaming pile of crap that got dumped on this poor guy.</p> <p>His main moment in the spotlight is in Job, where he keeps telling God \"sure, Job is great, because you haven't screwed with him enough yet,\" and God lets Satan screw with Job. Now, either God is a real prick, or Satan is doing his job and God is allowing it. Actually, scratch that, God is a prick in this story either way, if you kill someone's whole family of course he'll be in a bad mood. But if Satan is fulfilling his role, at least this makes some sense, that God's enemy didn't just walk up and say \"bro, I double dog dare you to completely destroy that dude's life,\" and God just does it. Satan's job, assigned by God, is to find a weakness and see if the person really is loyal and faithful. See it again in Zechariah 3:1-2, Satan is prosecuting Joshua, and God isn't having it. In Matthew 4:3-8, he comes to Jesus and tempts him to sin, just business as usual.</p> <p>But the real clinch on this idea is I Chronicles 21:1, where Satan caused David to do a census, but oh, wait, that was actually God, in II Samuel 24:1. Either the Bible is having a little trouble figuring out the difference between the Lord of all Evil and the Benevolent Creator of the Universe, or Satan was acting on God's orders, doing his job. This makes sense of the Book of Exodus too, where God keeps hardening Pharaoh's heart when Moses would come tell him what God wanted. Either God was playing an extremely sadistic game of \"why you hitting yourself\" with Pharaoh, or this was Satan doing what he's supposed to do. Either way, seems a little unfair, God had no reason to be testing Pharaoh's faith, I'm sure Pharaoh worshipped Ra, but Satan acting on God's orders at least keeps it from being complete nonsense, and this reading of it is fully justified by the confusion in Chronicles versus Samuel. The only way none of it makes sense at all is if you see Satan as God's enemy.</p> <p>And then that's it till Revelation, which we'll talk about later. Up to this point, Satan isn't King of Hell, or a rebel angel, or any of it. Ezekiel 28:11-19, Isaiah 14:12-15, and Luke 10:18 all have traditional interpretations of being a reference to Satan, but I'll tell you what, you go read them, not just those verses, but the entire page they're on, and then you try telling me they're about Satan. They're very much about other things. Satan as a secondary, veiled topic, well, it could be, maybe, but you don't want to play \"this verse is clearly about x, but it's also secretly about y\" with me, I'll turn your whole religion upside down. Outside of that, there are some scattered references that connect Satan to sin, and Paul in particular will not stop ragging on the poor guy, but we don't get any more insights into his nature or real, concrete actions.</p> <p>Then there's Revelation. Look, I could write you a whole book about each chapter of Revelation, and you could write a whole book telling all the reasons I'm wrong, and then a third person could come write another book saying how stupid we both are and how obvious the real answer is, and none of us would have solid ground to stand on because we're all trying to analyze what amounts to John having a divinely inspired acid trip. It's never totally clear whether John is describing the past, present, or future, and even if you somehow nailed that down he's still talking in metaphors, and we could discuss them all day and never get anywhere. Remember when highly educated scholars, smarter and better informed than me and you put together, knew exactly what it would look like when the Messiah came, then some carpenter's son came walking up like \"okay, guys, I'm here, let's go,\" and the scholars were all like \"uh, haha, no?\" Well, interpreting fever dreams sent by God ends like that every single time, so I'll tell you what I THINK it means, but if you think differently, you're perfectly entitled to.</p> <p>Revelation 12 shows a woman wearing a crown with 12 stars. She's having a baby, and a big dragon, identified as Satan, is sitting there, waiting for the baby to come out so he can eat it, because this baby will rule the Earth with a rod of iron. Well, the baby is born, Angels rescue it, Satan chases them to Heaven but gets booted out along with his Angels, verse 8 saying \"there was no longer any place for them in Heaven,\" which definitely implies they were all allowed there up to that point. So, to me, the woman is all 12 tribes of Judah, shown by the crown, the baby is Jesus, Satan gets fired from his role as divine DA once Jesus comes along, and Satan is understandably upset. If you'd had the same job for thousands of years, you would be too. Then Satan goes off and gives his power to a talking lion with ten horns, seven heads, and bear's feet, and we don't really hear from him anymore, till a spirit like a frog comes from his mouth later, and then he gets locked up for 1,000 years. I told you, you never know what's happening in Revelation.</p> <p>Pretty much what happened there was Jesus was born, and the new order of the day was mercy, so Satan got kicked out. He started raising a fuss, and God locked him up. Or maybe it wasn't that at all, but you know what it wasn't? Satan rebelling against God before Genesis, because if it was, who the hell are the woman and the baby? Making this work as a primordial event means twisting it and confusing the whole path even more than it already was, making me wonder why God would even tell John anything at all, if he's going to be that unclear about the whole thing. Revelation already borders on completely useless, don't make it worse to fit a theory that's not seen anywhere else in the whole Bible.</p> <p>Satan is Heaven's Quality Assurance guy, and if you ask me, he got fired 2,000 years ago. Now, given the timelines here, that also means he got out on parole 1,000 years ago, and if you want to say he went back to his old job, trying to prove God still needs him, well, that seems likely enough, given how upset he was about getting fired. He might even have more leeway now than he did before, without management looking over his shoulder, making him fill out reports. Satan can still be exactly who you thought, but the backstory the Church sold us on him was pure bull. Same as any regime, an enemy galvanizes the base, gives us something to unite against, and since God's whole deal is omnipotence, a worthwhile enemy has always been hard to find. The Church had to work with what little they had, and they invented Lucifer out of a divine prosecutor and a handful of verses that had nothing to do with him, because it was either that or bring back Ba'al.</p> <p>Turning to the Quran, the djinn Iblis is playing the part of Lucifer, in Surah Al-A'Raf 7:11-18 and Surah Sad 38:71-85, which both tell about how Iblis refused to bow to Allah's most recent creation, Man, bringing up all kinds of perfectly valid points about his superiority, but Allah wasn't having it and kicked him out. His position there was always kind of tenuous, a djinn basically being a demon, and far as Allah was concerned, this was the last straw. Other than that, the Quran connects him to sin and establishes him as Allah's enemy a lot more satisfactorily than the Bible does. Turning to classical literature, in Dante's Divine Comedy, Lucifer is barely mentioned, he's frozen in the lowest level of Hell, chewing on traitors. In Goethe's Faust and Marlowe's Doctor Faustus, he's a holder of knowledge, and he'll be glad to let you have it if you just give him your soul.</p> <p>But it's not until Milton's Paradise Lost where we really see Lucifer as we know him taking shape, a charismatic rebel, with all kinds of great lines about ruling in Hell rather than serving in Heaven, and the mind being its own place, and really just chock full of the kind of stuff that makes teenage rebels all tingly. Let me tell you, every single thing you think you know about Lucifer, Archangels, war in Heaven, anything, comes from this poem. Paradise Lost had a more profound effect on modern Christianity than the Bible did, and if you've read them both, you know it's true. Not that that's a bad thing, it's actually a really great read, but a poem from 1667 just doesn't carry the same theological weight as the Hebrew texts that predate most of the world's written records, does it? But technically there's nothing stopping it from being true, maybe Milton had a prophetic vision, which would really just make the Church of Satan an even bigger stain than it already is.</p> <p>See, Lucifer was all set up to be a bringer of knowledge and a rival to God. Given Satan's unclear position in the Bible and all the Biblical events that most definitely did not happen, from a scholarly, historical perspective, like the Flood, the conquest of Canaan, just really any number of things, it would have been laughably easy to paint the Bible as a book of lies, exaggerations, and omissions, a divine smear campaign against God's rival, who'd rather see humanity progress than be ignorant animals living in a garden. Lucifer could have been Prometheus all over again in a religion that promotes progress, the responsibility of higher beings to help the lower, and rejection of tyranny. Instead, the Church of Satan is a Halloween mask for Atheists who find there's not quite enough shock value in saying they don't believe in God. It's a bunch of teenage rebels making Internet memes, and a waste of the religion that could have easily swept the Western world.</p> <p>Not that it's entirely Anton LaVey's fault. All he really did was come along in 1966 and establish a standard for Atheists to rally around, promoting hedonism along with ethics that weren't tied to worship of a deity or fear of punishment after death. It was really the absolute twats who come after him that ruined it, doing things like co-opting the Cross of Saint Peter, which I guarantee you they did not know was and still is a thing, they just thought it would piss off Christians if they flipped the cross upside down. Or do you really think these guys deeply resonated with themes of humility and devotion to Christ? No, I didn't think so. It's really a prime example of what the Church of Satan is all about, shock value, contrarianism, and ignorant kids trying to get a reaction.</p> <p>And it is just such as epic waste. Lucifer had the recognition value. He had the backstory, mostly, just needed some easy, minor setups. The Church of Satan could have been a religion of helping the less fortunate, striving for progress, and challenging authority you think it's out of line, but instead it's just another form of teenagers writing dirty words inside bathroom stalls. It could have stood for something, if it had been run by serious people from the jump, and instead it stands for nothing. And it's really too late to take it back, it's firmly entrenched. So if any of you go off and start a Church of Prometheus, how about you take a good, long, hard look at Anton LaVey, and do your very best not to do one single thing he did?</p> <p>1: Rebel When You're Right - 3/3 I'll be rating the Lucifer of popular perception here, since we've already explored why the Biblical Satan really isn't what we're looking for. And look, no matter how offensive you find it, God had no right to keep humans as ignorant animals. Lucifer did us a solid here. Can't speak on his rebellion in Heaven, we don't get a clear view of whether he was actually being oppressed or not, but the Heaven scenes of Paradise Lost were the worst parts of the poem, so can't really blame the poor guy.</p> <p>2: No Dragons - 1/3 Just like Prometheus, this is inference, not actual myth, but come on. This guy would 100% throw up a false roadblock if he felt the need, no hesitation.</p> <p>3: Think it Through - 3/3 His battle in Paradise Lost was actually a fine plan, God just beat it by being God. Course, since this was God's first fight ever, Lucifer couldn't be expected to know that would happen.</p> <p>4: The Mesopotamian Method - 2/3 Lucifer isn't helping us because he cares about collaboration, he just wants to piss God off. But he does effectively collaborate with other Angels, so he sees the value of alliance, he just doesn't think we've got anything to offer. Gatekeeping loses you a point, big guy, everybody has something to contribute.</p> <p>Total: 9/12 Stripped down to basics, Lucifer is really just Prometheus, but a little bit more of a prick.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-earth/#iii-sun-wukong","title":"III. Sun Wukong","text":"<p>Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, is a figure in Chinese mythology. He was born from a stone egg on a mountain, and the light from his eyes got the attention of the Jade Emperor. When his people reported back that it was only a stone monkey, he shrugged and went back to his work. The monkey found other monkeys to play with, and he grew up with them. They liked to play in a stream, and one day they decided that whoever could find the source of the stream would be their king. Well, I don't want to ruin the suspense, but the stone monkey did it.</p> <p>One day one of his friends died, and he was so upset that he struck off into the world to find an immortal to teach him how to beat death. He found a village, but everyone was afraid of him, they'd never seen a stone monkey before, they ran away and the monkey wandered off into the woods. He heard a woodcutter whistling a tune, and he liked it so much he asked the woodcutter where he learned it, and found out he'd picked it up from an immortal in a temple in the forest. Well, the monkey followed the directions, found the temple, and met Puti Zushi, who refused to let him in at first, so the monkey camped outside the door for months. Puti Zushi was impressed with his determination and let him in, giving him the name Sun Wukong. Puti Zushi taught Sun Wukong a lot, and ended his education by telling him never to show off his skills, because people would want to learn, and this knowledge can't go to just anyone.</p> <p>Sun Wukong knows he needs a weapon out in the world, but can't find one he likes. He eventually goes off to the palace of Ao Guang, a Dragon King, who tries to turn him away, but Sun Wukong barges in anyway. Ao Guang sees that Sun Wukong is too strong to be turned away, so he has his servants bring out weapons for the monkey to choose from. He finally picks the golden-banded staff, a two-ton stick that can be as big as a pillar or as small as a needle. He also gets a golden chainmail shirt, a phoenix feather cap, and cloudwalking boots.</p> <p>Sun Wukong goes back home, and he expands his kingdom to include a lot more animals than just his monkey tribe. But Ao Guang doesn't like that this monkey just walked in and took his best weapon and armor, and sent Hell to collect his soul, which is a really useful connection to have, I can think of a few people I'd like to try it on. Sun Wukong scrubs his name out of the Book of Life and Death, along with the names of his friends, so he can't die and his soul can't be collected. Well, the Jade Emperor gets involved at this point, bringing his whole army down on Sun Wukong. But Sun Wukong has too good a weapon and too many soldiers, and he beats back the armies of Heaven.</p> <p>The Jade Emperor finally decides to ally with Sun Wukong and make him a part of the empire to solve the problem. He's made Protector of Horses, and finds he's the stable boy for the cloud horses, so he frees them and returns to Earth, giving himself the title of Great Sage, Heaven's Equal, because he's not very good at subtlety. The Jade Emperor agrees he can use that title and makes him Guardian of the Heavenly Peach Garden, and Sun Wukong accepts, but finds he's just a gardener who's not invited to Heaven's social events. He gets drunk, steals a bunch of stuff, and runs back to Earth. The Jade Emperor gets his armies together to crush him, but it doesn't start off any better for him the second time around. Sun Wukong beats all the armies till Erlang Shen, the Emperor's nephew, fights him. They're evenly matched, there's a lot of shapeshifting, and finally Laozi throws his diamond jade ring at Sun Wukong from behind, which knocks him out, so that must have been one big damn ring.</p> <p>Well, the Emperor tries several ways of killing Sun Wukong, but none of them work out, and eventually he's put in a forge to be melted down. This has the opposite effect, 49 days later he comes out, fully hardened and now able to see evil with his fiery golden eyes. He goes after the Emperor, who summons Buddha. Sun Wukong argues to Buddha that he should be the new Emperor, and Buddha says he can prove his power by sitting in his palm, then jumping out. Sun Wukong sees no problem with that, sits in Buddha's palm, jumps, runs, and cartwheels as far as he can, and reaches five giant pillars. He thinks this must be the end of the Universe, so he pees on one, as anyone would if they found the pillars at the end of the Universe, but they turn out to be Buddha's fingers. He turns his hand into a mountain, trapping Sun Wukong.</p> <p>Well, he stays there for 500 years, until a priest, Tang Sanzang, comes by. He needs protection on his road trip, and Sun Wukong can kick Heaven's ass, so he's the obvious choice. He frees Sun Wukong on the condition that he helps the priest in return, and puts a golden circlet on the monkey's head that tightens when the priest chants, to keep him in line. They take a long trip to India and back to China, Sun Wukong learns about Buddhism, and in the end achieves Buddhahood. He gives up on being the new Emperor and settles for being the King of all Monkeys, which is probably a lot more fun anyway.</p> <p>1: Rebel When You're Right - 1/3 He really created his own problems when he demanded equipment from Ao Guang, and once that was dealt with, should have just gone back to his monkeys and forgot about Heaven and the Emperor. But he got all caught up in his ego, and that got him into trouble.</p> <p>2: No Dragons - 3/3 Sun Wukong doesn't accept limitations, he even sees the Jade Emperor's position as being up for debate.</p> <p>3: Think it Through - 1/3 He's not a thinker, he'd rather hit things till they break. The fact that it works out for him so often doesn't make it the right answer.</p> <p>4: The Mesopotamian Method - 3/3 He's always willing to work with others, he just gets cranky when he feels undervalued. Understandable, the Jade Emperor really was being a prick, but the right answer was to walk away, not pick a fight with God.</p> <p>Total: 8/12 He lost a lot of points for choosing force over strategy, and for choosing ego over retreat. He didn't need these problems, he created them himself. The lesson here is to say \"maybe I can, but should I?\" He eventually made it to Heaven, but he had to learn he couldn't punch his way in.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-earth/#iv-my-greatest-weakness","title":"IV.

You live in two dimensions. You can go up, down, and to both sides, but you can't come off the paper. Depth doesn't exist. You're fine without it, can't even imagine it. You live your little stick figure life with your stick figure friends, and life is just peachy.</p> <p>Then, one day, someone outside the paper sticks a knife into it, and it skewers your stick figure neighbor, Bob, as he's telling you about the little stick flowers he's going to put in front of his house. While you're glad that conversation is over, you're somewhat horrified that Bob just got ripped to shreds right in front of you. Remember, you can't see anything but the two dimensions, you have no inkling of some three-dimensional knife-wielding god. You can see the effects though, and you start telling everyone about unseen forces that can just end everything, everywhere, and they don't even need a reason. Your stick figure friends and family are understanding and supportive at first, but gradually it's too much for them to handle. It means nothing to them that you're getting letters from other stick figures who've seen the same kind of unexplained phenomena, they just figure crazy loves company. They lock you away in a stick figure asylum because they're afraid you might be dangerous, you're probably the one who killed Bob after all, and you live the rest of your life there.</p> <p>Just like those 2D people don't know about the 3D world, we can't imagine what the 4D, 5D, or 6D worlds look like, and interacting with them is somewhere between difficult and impossible. Marzod is a higher dimensional energy, which we know because we can't see it, even though Qi, Brahman, Mana, Prana, Kawsay, and more all tell us, independently of each other, that it's there. It's running a circuit of your body, hitting a network of key points, like an electrical circuit with a lot of light bulbs. The exact locations of those bulbs have some variance across systems, but the main thing is, all the molecules of your body stick out into the higher dimensions and interact with Marzod. Higher dimensions are trippy places, where time and space are intertwined. That's the basis of the interconnection of Marzod, that it WAS connected, and so always IS connected.</p> <p>I'll go over that differently for you. Think of the timeline as a room. You've got the Roman Empire over in the corner, you've got the creation of the Universe over by the window, you've got Genghis Khan around here somewhere, maybe he's over by the coffee pot. Now, they can't interact with each other, they're limited, they have no choice but to take a predetermined path around the room. Not you, though, you God of Time, you. You can go anywhere you want, because time and space are the same thing, or close enough.</p> <p>If time and space are the same thing, then it doesn't matter if space separates two things, just go to a time when they were together and there's still a connection. Here on this end table, you've got a bird. On the couch next to it, the bird lost a feather. Now, one of these limited little people picks up the feather and casts a spell on it. Somehow, they accessed energy that's just as free as you are, and when they cast that spell, it went for that feather in all its time of existence, including when it was attached to the bird. You're shocked beyond words. Reaching from the couch to the end table is nothing to you, but for one of them to do it should be impossible.</p> <p>That's the higher dimensions for you. That's why there's so many common threads in myth and magic across cultures that had nothing to do with each other. They all used energy to affect Marzod, and from there touched the higher dimensions. Sympathetic magic, psychic imprints, telepathy, telekinesis, this was all stuff we could see at work, but we didn't really have a good line on how, so our results were spotty at best. We knew point A, we knew point B, but science hadn't evolved to a point yet where it could draw us a line between the two. Basic science spent millenia telling us all these things were lies, misunderstandings, and kind of dumb, and we bought it. Turns out, as in most things, you have to go beyond the basics.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#ii-nuts-and-bolts","title":"II: Nuts and Bolts","text":"<p>Marzod is another word for Aether, an outdated word in today's scientific world, but what it means is a quantum field, the thing all matter and energy is made from. Depending on the type of field generated, you can take your pick of all 118 elements of the periodic table. String theory tells us what makes the fields different. Nutshell version, rather than each molecule being a speck, it's a string, the rest of the string sticking off in a higher dimension we can't see, we can only see the tiny section of the string that vibrates in a way we're equipped to perceive. Different vibrations, different quantum fields, different elements.</p> <p>To make it clearer, let's talk about sound. I'm sure you know sound exists in a wide band, some of it we can hear, some we can't, like a dog whistle. Now, imagine you could only hear sound in a much, much narrower band than you already do. Let's say I've got a guitar, and I pluck the top string, the big E. It's vibrating all over the string, and the further you get from the bridge, the more it's waving around. You, with your limitation, can only hear the part of the string about an inch from the bridge, but that doesn't stop the rest of the string from being there, does it? Just means you can only perceive a tiny part.</p> <p>That's string theory, that all matter isn't made up of particles, but strings, and you can only perceive the part that vibrates a certain way. Now, you can hear that big E about an inch from the bridge, but if I pluck the A string, it's thinner, it vibrates more, you have to move closer to the bridge for the part you can hear, say half an inch. For the D string, a quarter inch. G, B, and small E, you can't hear those at all. Expand this back to the Universe, you can only interact with the part of the string that vibrates the right way, the rest is invisible, intangible, you can't interact with it at all through your five basic senses.</p> <p>Now, you can't expect all the strings in the Universe to carry the same tune forever. Within certain bounds, that's fine, it creates a new element maybe, or the laws of physics hiccup a little in a certain spot, but the Universe keeps playing its song. Sometimes, though, part of the orchestra starts playing the wrong tune, they're copying their neighbor rather than watching the conductor. When we're talking about Marzod, the building blocks of reality, that makes its own little section of a new reality totally different from ours, where our elements, our laws of physics, our understanding of everything, gets swept out and replaced. When that happens, we call it a black hole. There's no known upper limit on how far matter can be compressed, so there may be worlds in there smaller than quarks, with life forms that can't even begin to imagine the size and scope of their universe, only a black hole to us.</p> <p>If that last thought made you feel big and powerful, hang on while I shrink you back down, Alice in Wonderland style. Our Universe, with its 118 elements, is very intricate, very complex. It's a long way from the original Universe of Marzod, which you might as well call the single cell organism all universes evolved from. That means that our Universe, in all its wonderful, intricate complexity, is most likely a black hole, within a black hole, within a black hole, hundreds or even thousands of times, each one just a little more complex than the last. Imagine our Universe, boundless to us, as a tiny percentage of space inside another universe which is itself just a tiny percentage of space inside another, repeated until you get to the original Marzod, the biggest universe of all. It must be the same way people felt when they figured out those tiny pricks of light in the sky were giant suns, each surrounded by planets, stretching out into infinity.</p> <p>But these universes aren't permanent. Black holes put out Hawking Radiation, which is a fancy name for the fact that as a black hole ages, it loses its density. Things tend toward balance, and the black holes return to being more like the rest of our universe. Remember when you were a kid, and you looked at adults and thought of how you'd do everything different, you could never be like them, it's impossible? Look at you now. Time showed you why things are the way they are, smoothed out your rough edges, now you're one of those adults, with kids looking at you saying \"that'll never be me.\" Universes are like that, it just takes hundreds of billions of years to see any change as they all evolve back to the original Marzod.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#iii-life-and-death-of-a-universe","title":"III: Life and Death of a Universe","text":"<p>When a new universe begins, it's only Marzod, Marzod that became so different from the rest of its universe that they couldn't exist together. Alternate laws of reality formed, and the new Marzod exists as a hole in reality within the old universe. To us, that's a black hole, to the ones inside, it's a boundless expanse, whose limits they can't fully imagine in a way that does it justice. This is called the Black Hole Cosmology Hypothesis, if you want to look into it more and see I didn't just make up something because it was cool. Moving from one universe to the other involves such huge shifts in reality itself that there's no chance a living being could survive it. Do you think you could live in a universe made of mashed potatoes, where your blood exists outside your body, three miles away, and termites who communicate in shades of the color blue are the dominant species? Probably not, and all the stuff I just described is stuff you recognize and have words to describe, so imagine how much worse it can get.</p> <p>But Marzod doesn't just sit there, it starts to change. In a way, it's the first choice within that universe. Then other bits of Marzod change in response. Soon the whole batch of it is changing just as fast as it can, all parts in competition with each other, feeding on each other, going from gas to solid matter to planets, where life sparks and evolves, all fighting each other, everyone trying to get one over on the rest, from evolutionary arms races to more literal arms races, involving higher intelligence and even gods. The Hindi see this as Brahman manifesting Prakriti, matter, and Purusha, consciousness, and if you're wondering, they're locked in an eternal struggle too. No form of Marzod likes anything very different from itself, sees it as a threat, and it'll change to get a leg up on the competition. But conservation of energy is important at all levels, and it usually won't jump too high, just enough to get an edge, so maybe you get a prophet instead of a god, or something even tamer, like a new rock, just enough to advance a tiny bit.</p> <p>This creates a system of cause and effect, and nothing can happen outside that loop, so in a way, everything was predetermined from the moment of the very first universe of the very first Marzod, because you can't have any effect without a cause. You've never really made a decision in your life, it was made for you, because some stimulus caused an expression of chemicals in your brain, a firing of electrons, so you couldn't help but think what you thought and do what you did. One thing reacts to another, and the outcome may have too many variables to be predictable, but it was always inevitable. Newton said if you knew the location and velocity of every particle in the Universe, you could predict everything, forever, but that was impossible because the more you know its location, the less you know its velocity, and that cuts both ways. LaPlace's Demon is pretty much the same thing, that if you knew all causes, you'd know all effects, but that's just not practical.</p> <p>But that doesn't mean everything is written and you can stop trying to do anything. The struggle is written too, and nothing can happen without it, because there's still other forces trying to bring THEIR will forward. If you do nothing, that's written too, and probably means your failure is written shortly after. Remember there's no effect without cause, and most of the things you want are effects of your causes. Does it really matter that your causes are also effects? If you choose inaction, what do you think is written from there? You can see it in Greek myths, the Moirai, or Fates, had everything predetermined, but that didn't absolve the heroes of their responsibility to be heroic, because how is the path ever going to get there if nobody struggles to make it happen?</p> <p>But the struggle has its limits, and at some point the disharmony gets too out of hand. It's too much for the universe to tolerate, the rules of reality get bent past their breaking point. One thing that can happen, we know already, is a black hole. But sometimes it's less dramatic, it's only an ice age or a meteor or the fall of a civilization. Ask the Norse, the Mayans, the Hindi, this is not the first world to ever exist, the slate has been wiped before, by Ragnarok, the Five Suns, Pralaya. The world is born, life happens, struggles, the planet gets wiped clean, and it starts over again. If you expand your mythological net there, look into previous types of human, failed drafts, so to speak, that got wiped off the board and everything reset, that myth has an echo in pretty much every culture.</p> <p>Why is that? Why does every culture think the world keeps getting reset? Because it's happening, every time evolution, instead of giving some animal fangs or a stinger or camouflage, gives it time travel or antigravity or something else that can't exist. Sometimes a god can find a way to exist without breaking everything, even though he technically shouldn't, but if things go too far, the Marzodian reset gets hit, at least in a localized area. Marzod's need for balance kicks in, and with no response to this new thing, it's nope, sorry, that's out of bounds, everybody back to your starting positions. And if it's too big to wipe out with a cataclysm, it turns into a black hole instead, and the creation of a whole new Universe. Marzod says \"as long as you're under my roof, young man, you'll live by my laws of reality,\" and the new Marzod packs up, punches a hole in reality, and starts a new universe where it can do whatever it wants.</p> <p>Course, if it's a systemic issue rather than a localized one, that's when the entire Universe gets tanked. And that's bad news for just about everybody, including all the black holes, and all the black holes within them, and all the black holes within those. The collapse of one universe could easily mean the collapse of hundreds or even thousands of universes. So, you know, maybe it'd be a good idea if you did your part to promote balance and unity. Next time you have a choice between selfishness and generosity, or anger and forgiveness, consider that your choice might be the straw that breaks the Marzod's back. Next time someone cuts you off in traffic, remember thousands of universes might hang on whether you honk or let it go.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#iv-lets-do-the-time-warp-again","title":"IV: Let's Do the Time Warp Again","text":"<p>Look, I won't lie to you, this is going to be a tough one. We're dealing with time and relativity, and that's never easy, we're just not designed to understand time in any way but forward at a certain rate. Still, I'll do my best to write it, and if you do your best to read it, I think we'll get there.</p> <p>According to Hubble's Law, the Universe is constantly expanding, which probably isn't news to you. What may be news is Dark Energy, which is, against all known physics, making us pick up speed as we go. In my theory, the reason for that is a special particle I call Marzod, a particle that has negative mass. According to Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence, matter and energy are the same thing in different states, so if you plot the states of matter on a line, you've got Solid, Liquid, Gas, Plasma, and \"Plasma\" is usually divided by type of energy rather than mass, but it's division by mass that's important to my theory. See, you've got heavy energy, which is dark matter, that's energy that's so close to being matter it's got some of matter's most basic qualities, and at the other end of the scale, you've got photons, with no mass at all.</p> <p>Now, according to String Theory, more vibration makes less mass, so the photons are vibrating a lot, while solids hardly at all. The big question is, what happens when you make a photon vibrate harder, channel more energy into it? You'd get a particle that responds opposite to everything, it goes through time backward, if you push it left it goes right, all kinds of weird stuff, because our Universe is built on positive mass, and negative mass would allow your mutated photon to go faster than light, it'd do everything wrong, according to theories involving tachyons or CPT symmetry. It would even have opposite gravity, responding the wrong way to Newton's Universal Gravitation, where mass attracts mass. That means, while we're drawn to it, it doesn't like us back, and it runs away while we chase, because we just can't take a hint. But it's kind of the Marzod's fault, because it's sending mixed signals. When it runs away in reverse time, it's running toward us in regular time.</p> <p>So what happens when we meet? Really good question, it could be a massive explosion, it could be nothing, we don't know because there are a lot of precedents in conflict and we can't exactly stick Marzod under a microscope to find out. One thing that could happen is it acts like a magnet, and when we meet, the polarization either cancels out or flips. If it cancels out, Marzod keeps running to the center of the Universe because of momentum, and if it flips, it still does that, but faster because it's pushing off us, attracted to us in reverse time, so running away. We do know there'd be no physical interaction, because extremely high energy has no mass and no substance, so either way, we pass right through and continue our journey, us to the edge, Marzod to the center. It's not clear whether life on Earth would survive the meeting, but let's not bring more questions into this Jenga tower of a theory.</p> <p>So we eventually will hit the edge of the Universe, what happens then? If the Black Hole Cosmology Hypothesis is correct and our universe is just a black hole inside another universe, we'd hit the event horizon of the black hole, get bombarded with Hawking Radiation, quantum fluctuations, and the upshot is all the matter gets supercharged, way past the plasma level, and suddenly we're Marzod particles instead of normal matter. All that momentum we had is suddenly pushing us the opposite way, because we respond wrong to force. We make a sharp U-turn and head for the center of the Universe. But what happened to the Marzod from before, where did it go? Glad you asked.</p> <p>Marzod kept right on its road trip, going faster and gaining energy as it did, because it does everything in reverse. Finally, it all hit the center, and all that energy gathered up in one ultra-dense spot just exploded. A lot of the energy was spent, and the Marzod wasn't Marzod anymore, it didn't have the high energy required, it was just normal matter. That's the Big Bang, if you haven't guessed it yet, and this theory offers an explanation for why it exploded, given that matter only ever attracts matter, and where all the Universe's energy came from, because it can't be created out of nowhere. Energy condenses into matter, but how the hell does matter become energy, or explode? Particles that have such high energy they have negative mass and do everything opposite, that's how.</p> <p>So where did the original Big Bang come from? Easy, that's Black Hole Cosmology Hypothesis again. The hole yanked a lot of matter and energy in from its original Universe, and once it had enough energy to supercharge the mass in the center, it exploded. As for the actual seed of the black hole, well, if you figure out what causes that you be sure and let CERN know, they're kind of dying to find out. It's a bit of the fabric of the Universe that's going through its rebellious teenage years, is about all we've got on that.</p> <p>Look, I won't pretend this theory is perfect or beyond contradiction, but it's built out of mainstream scientific theories. All the physicists can vouch for the building blocks, if not the house I built, so I think this is about as solid as it gets unless we can find some eyewitness testimony from the creation of the Universe. And since God has left humanity on read for the last handful of centuries, I think this is the best we can do.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#v-marzod-cancrorum","title":"V: Marzod Cancrorum","text":"<p>We covered the matter last chapter, now let's talk souls. The Marzod flowing back sometimes gets snagged on higher-dimensional aspects of some types of matter, and that creates life. It's not heading back to the Bang, it's trapped in a circuit of a body, and this may not be the first time. The more times the loop repeats, the more of the Marzod flying back at the matter has been a soul at some point. Now, it wasn't always intelligent, it could have been a plant or an animal. In fact, there could be loops without intelligent life at all, or where there's no color red, or where it's all space jellyfish with laser eyes, because we've always had more matter flying in from our parent universe, causing little differences in the loop, little butterfly effects that didn't happen any of the previous times. This might be why some people are so good at being sentient, and some people really suck at it, the successful ones have been sentient more times, and their innate memories are giving just enough of a push to tell them what works and what doesn't.</p> <p>Now, I hasten to add, if you want to try to spin that into your ignorant, bigoted worldview, you take that somewhere else, because there's no basis for that. All humans have the same hardware, the only notable difference is software, and if you're not on board with that, let me know and I'll send you a list of remedial biology classes in your area. And the hardware all being the same, why the hell would Marzod pick one race, gender, or caste over another? So, some people have more innate understanding of complex society than others, some have less, and it's random. Some Marzod snags on lifeforms that have high intelligence, some snags on a blade of grass instead. Don't brag to me because you think you won the lottery a bunch of times, because misunderstanding my point that badly will only prove to me that you didn't win it as many times as you think. My point isn't exclusion or establishing hierarchy, my point is harmony, just like it was five minutes ago, and every time before that.</p> <p>While the dimmer bulbs take some time to absorb that, let's the rest of us talk about crabs. Did you know five different species have looked at their bodies and said \"this sucks, wanna go be crabs?\" It's true, all these species, independently of each other, evolved into crabs, because the crab isn't the most graceful, or the smartest, or the toughest, but it's the best, most resilient and capable body type for its environment, and all the other species are waiting on is the accidental mutation that turns them into crabs too. Evolution is a messy, chaotic process that weeds out inferior forms and converges toward the best, from all directions, because there's only one \"best.\" In the ocean, that's the crab, and if you want to look into it more, it's called carcinization. Carcinisation if you prefer the British.</p> <p>So, over the course of many universal loops, the number of souls who've been sentient grows, and they learn harmony is the best way. They may not recognize or remember it on a conscious level, but their innate memory helps prod them along. Even people who are evil and successful eventually end up there, because when did you ever meet someone who was a self-centered prick AND had a fulfilling personal life? They learn to do better. And it's this innate memory that sometimes leads to prophecy, because the soul sees how things are shaping up and recognizes familiar ground from past loops. Some are very similar to the current loop, others are so different they come through like a bad acid trip.</p> <p>Eventually, everyone reaches perfection. There's only one \"best,\" and we're all evolving that way, remember? Eventually there's a loop where everyone is doing the best possible thing in every situation, and everything is great. It's Heaven, to borrow from religion. Then our Universe ends.</p> <p>Don't worry, everything keeps going. Our Universe ended because it's just a black hole inside another universe, and it finally hit the edge, got turned to Marzod, and is rocketing backward to THAT Big Bang. And now our perfection gets to influence that universe, cause it to evolve our way until it catches up to us. This keeps going, all the way up the chain, until we get back to the original universe, where Marzod Infanti first started evolving and experimenting, through its stages of Marzod Juvenilis, all the way to Marzod Cancrorum, the crab. It tried chaos, order, war, peace, created an infinite number of universes, and they all evolved to the crab. Perfection was inevitable, because imperfection is unstable.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#vi-qi","title":"VI: Qi","text":"<p>Everything sticks into the higher dimensions to some extent, just like everything has width, height, depth, but certain points in your body interact with Marzod more than others. It's hard to say why, since we can't see these dimensions. It's not immediately clear why one part of the body attracts Marzod more than others, but the Indians call these points Chakras, the Chinese call them Meridians, and basically what we're talking about is a place where Marzod is drawn in its circuit of the body. By changing these points and the paths between them, you change the flow. You affect the higher dimensions by affecting the flow of Marzod.</p> <p>A neat concept, you're thinking, but so what? I'll tell you so what, while there's some disagreement on where these points are, depending on which system you pick, they all agree your brain is a big one. That's why focus, intent, and force of will play such a large role here. You're changing the bloodflow and bioelectrical activity in your brain, which changes how that node interacts with Marzod. You're changing the flow of higher dimensional energy just by thinking about it hard enough.</p> <p>Now, where do those other nodes come in? Your body works as a unit, and your brain is the command center. Those other nodes are pitching in, taking orders from the brain, reporting back what happens. The practice of magic and spirituality is a full-body event, and the more you've got your body in line, the more effective you'll be. Any number of belief systems involve something like Marzod, as we've already touched on, and most of them agree good mental, emotional, and physical health is the biggest key to making that force do what it should. All over Asia, whether India, China, Japan, Tibet, they take an approach of direct stimulation of the nodes, whether it's acupuncture or pressure therapy. The focus of those is usually internal, personal health and such, but it stands to reason that machines produce the best results when all their parts work.</p> <p>Now the interesting question is, once we've got the nodes operating at peak efficiency, what can we do to amplify the effect? Putting low voltage, heat, or vibration into a node is introducing more energy, giving Marzod something different. There's not a lot of info on this, so we're blazing a brand new trail there. People looking for external effects pretty much just use their brain nodes, the effect of the others is unexplored from that perspective. But there's nothing stopping you from trying. It'll take some work, figuring out where another node is, there's not such wide agreement on the location of others, but once you've found one, go nuts. Stimulate it any way you can think of and see what happens.</p> <p>Meantime, for those of us who are less adventurous, it's all about focus. That, and making sure our bodies are a decent circuit for the energy. Exercise, don't eat garbage, and try to stay relaxed and positive. The better your internal mechanism is ticking, the more you can do with Marzod. I never saw a circuit yet that didn't see a power loss if the wires were screwed up. Your brain is the main thing, but it's not the only thing. If your wiring is bad, it doesn't really matter if your breaker box is in prime shape, the lights still won't come on.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#vii-kick-rocks-casper","title":"VII: Kick Rocks, Casper","text":"<p>Let me first say, if you haven't read Of Ghosts and Gods in the Book of Water, you're going to have a hard time understanding this chapter. Nutshell version, spirits are higher dimensional energy, and they collect third dimensional energy to do stuff in our dimension. If you've got a spirit causing you trouble, the best thing to do about it is take away his energy, but before we get started, simmer down a little, because most unfriendly spirits are just frustrated. We've talked about how it's hard for them to communicate, they've been trying and you're not picking up what they're laying down. You moved into their house, you're all in their space, and you don't take notice when they ask you to back off, course they're a little cranky. Before you go on the warpath, communicate with them. Hire a pro if you need to. I'm sure you can work something out.</p> <p>The flip side of that is, some people are just dicks. They were born dicks, they were dicks all through their lives, and they're dicks in death, and the only thing that'll make them behave is a swift boot to the ass. That's where this chapter gives you some help. Cultures through history, all over the world, have seen spirits driven off by all these things, and now that we understand Marzod and energy, we have a good idea why.</p> <p>First, Iron. Iron is a ground, if you connect it to the Earth. Any energy that comes near gets sucked in, that's exactly how a lightning rod works. While a wire might just irritate a ghost, taking little sips of his energy supply, a big iron I-beam sunk in the ground is an energy vacuum. Silver is even better, it's got near 100% conductivity, but once it tarnishes that drops a lot.</p> <p>Bodies of water are bad news for spirits too. You can't carry a lake in your pocket, or at least I never met anyone who did, but it's good to keep in mind that water is a conductor, and if it's touching the dirt it's a natural ground, which will suck the energy out of any ghost that comes near. If a ghost is chasing you and you're unarmed, I'd head for the nearest natural water and jump in. It'd be a hell of a powerful ghost who can keep chasing.</p> <p>Crystals and mirrors have been shown across cultures and continents to repel ghosts, and my best guess is because of light refraction. Since spirits can only interact through energy, they see energy different from us. He'll see every beam of light, and all of a sudden you've sent beams all over the room. At the very least, it'd be confusing and overwhelming to navigate a room full of scattered light if that was the main thing you could see. Hard to zero in on a human's energy if the room is full of it. Salt does it better than anything else, each grain is a crystal, covered in irregular, reflective surfaces. You spill a salt shaker, the room's just full of interference.</p> <p>Remember the part about how Marzod is a quantum field? High levels of energy will disrupt those. Ghosts feed on energy, but there's such a thing as too much of a good thing. Cultures all over the world have seen lots of energy, like a cannon or the sun or a blazing fire, drive spirits off. This will depend heavily on the spirit's strength and the strength of what noise, light, or heat you produce. This is not a good first choice, it can backfire in all the obvious ways, like fighting a pit bull with a bucket of fried chicken. Still, if you're in a bind, give it a shot. Worst that can happen is the ghost kills you quicker than it already was.</p> <p>Last, air pollution, usually smoke in ancient times, makes it hard for ambient energy to focus, which really messes with a ghost's ability to do anything, plus string theory tells us all those particles are really filling up the higher dimensions. You can't hurt it with smoke, but you might keep it from hurting you. Word of warning, though, smoke is only an annoyance most of the time. Incense, using small amounts of thin smoke, is used all over Asia for spirit work, and gods all over the world ate sacrifices on altars billowing smoke every which way. It might chase off a weak ghost, or one who's not real motivated to stay, but it's not a weapon for a ghost hunter.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#viii-drawing-the-line","title":"VIII: Drawing the Line","text":"<p>Remember when we talked about string theory? Well, in our dimension, that string vibrates and presents a certain way, but in another dimension, it's presenting in a totally different way. And because of the work of an obscure, mostly unknown German scientist of the 20th century, Albert Einstein, we know matter is only energy that's not moving around a lot, it's a spectrum, not a hard division. So a solid is matter on the far end of the spectrum, water is a bit closer to the middle, gas is even closer, then plasma is the other end of the scale, which is about as specific as naming all solids \u201crock,\u201d but dark matter is an outlier you might know. It gets all covered up in layers of misunderstanding and pseudoscience by people trying to understand it as matter, but it's actually really simple, it's energy with mass. It's so close to the borderline that it's actually got the most basic quality that matter has, which is gravitational force. It'd be more accurate, and much clearer, to call it heavy energy, but I don't think we're going to get a name change at this point.</p> <p>But the point is, the same substance can be matter in any of the three forms, or it can be energy, and it all depends on how it's vibrating. That means energy on our plane is matter in someone else's, because everything is relative, that's another theory from that Einstein guy. To us, fire isn't solid, because its particles are moving so much faster than ours. To some being made of extreme high energy, the flame on a candle would be like a lead brick. Any energy we can create would be a solid object, so when you chant, or the light is just right, or the temperature changes, you're creating solid objects in other dimensions, from the perspective of beings made of extremely high energy. It's hard to know exactly what that looks like to them, but that's where you lean on tradition, see how spirits usually respond to what you're doing.</p> <p>That brings us to symbols, one of the oldest methods of changing the energy of an environment. Problem with traditional symbols is a lot of them come from looking pretty or fitting a metaphor rather than observed effects. And even the functional ones may get changed over time, ancient people not really understanding the importance of color, materials, or size here and their interaction with the light, heat, and EM spectrum. Looking at it as magic rather than science leads someone to think a complicated symbol made of copper, placed in the sun at noon is just as effective when scratched on a doorpost with charcoal. So, now that you see the challenge here, if you're still interested, here's how you can start to untie this knot.</p> <p>If I drew up every symbol that exists, this book would be entirely too damn long. What I will do for you is give you my general rules of thumb on symbology. Across the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Africa, as far back as you care to trace it, there are certain shapes and colors in symbols that always mean the same thing. There's always outliers if your sample size is \"all cultures ever,\" but these are the usual suspects. There'll always be frills and fluff stuck on by people who like decorating, but if your chosen symbol is supposed to do something and it has the right shape and color in it, I'd say it's legit.</p> <p>Circle: Harmony</p> <p>Square or rectangle: Solidity</p> <p>Triangles or Chevrons</p> <p>Down: Blessings</p> <p>Up: Power</p> <p>Right: Action</p> <p>Left: Thought</p> <p>Red: Vitality</p> <p>Orange: Creativity</p> <p>Yellow: Enlightenment</p> <p>Blue: Peace</p> <p>Green: Growth</p> <p>Purple: Mystery</p> <p>But if generalities in tradition don't do it for you, good news is, I know how you can do better. Bad news is, you could spend the rest of your life on this project.</p> <p>First, research a bunch of symbols across cultures. Find the oldest version of them you can, so you can minimize the chance someone came along and changed it. You need to know all the conditions, the material, the size, how it's used, when it's used, all five thousand variables that go along with it. I'd keep this narrowed down to one single type of symbol, one single effect, for reasons that'll be clear to you in step five. Keep in mind ancient people rarely had pure materials to work with, so the effect may be less a function of their main material and more about the impurities.</p> <p>Second, know the difference between a symbol that has power and a symbol that's asking for help. If it's a \"set it and forget it\" deal, it's probably doing its own work, but if it comes with a ritual, and most especially if it comes with a sacrifice, it's probably a signal flare. Either is fine, but know the difference.</p> <p>Third, and this is the part that's going to be expensive, you make all these symbols. Make sure you don't screw them up, it'd be a real shame if you did all this for nothing.</p> <p>Fourth, and this part is expensive too, you need to get all the equipment to measure energy that comes off these symbols. Light in both visible and invisible bands, EM field, temperature, sound resonance, anything you can think of. Take these readings many, many times, because at this point you've invested so much time and money that you really can't afford to half-ass it.</p> <p>Fifth, compare the readings for similarities. Remember most of these symbols are garbage, so you're not looking for majority consensus, not even close. I'd say, if you've done 100 symbols, ten of them being in agreement is enough to say you've found the energy band that gets Marzod to do what you want.</p> <p>Sixth step is optional, but at this point let's go all the way. Now you can look at artificially reproducing that energy. If a bunch of stone age people stumbled across this energy band by laying different stuff down in different patterns till something happened, surely you can do it better with modern technology.</p> <p>As you can see, this can't be a single-person operation. You need a fairly large research team and quite a bit of money to invest if you're going to get enough symbols for an accurate sample size. Still, any breakthrough at all here would be a huge step forward in a criminally understudied field, scientifically speaking. For those of us who don't have a couple hundred grand to invest in this, though, it's better to just stick with tradition.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#part-two-history","title":"Part Two: History","text":""},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#i-geographical-bottlenecks","title":"I: Geographical Bottlenecks","text":"<p>About 70,000 years ago, man migrated out of Africa, and woman must have gone along with him, or that would have been a short, lonely story. We weren't the first species to leave, several went before us, and I guess our ancestors figured it must have worked out for them when they didn't come back, so they followed. They packed up their tools, their stories, and their gods, and they hit the road, and the thing about the migration is it never stopped. We'd settle somewhere a while, then food would get scarce or a new threat would show up, and we'd pick up and move, taking our ideas and technology with us. Now, you couldn't predict where we'd end up if we headed away from the center of the European, African, Asian landmass, but if we headed toward the center, it was the Middle East every time. An idea or innovation might spread across its continent without crossing the Fertile Crescent, but in the days before ships, you weren't crossing to another continent without passing through the bottleneck of the Red, Black, and Mediterranean Seas, creating a situation where any idea worth having on those three continents, given enough time, would inevitably hit that area.</p> <p>You ever wonder why those people were the earliest ones to invent agriculture, writing, math, big cities, pretty much all the defining traits of civilization? It's because they got exposed to everyone's ideas, all the time, and the Mayan, Aztec, and Incan cultures got that same boost over in the Americas. Any culture farther to the edges might have their own interesting and unique spin on whatever ideas came from their own continent, but they'd be missing most of what came from other continents, and that's why the Inuit, Scandinavians, South and West Africans, East Asians, and Argentinans were all so late to the game, compared to Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica. They weren't stupid, they just didn't have as much foot traffic, outside ideas didn't get to them, they were on their own. Even after ships were around, cultures far inland still had the same problem. A culture advances based on how much contact it has with others, that's a basic fact. That, and its ability to grow a food surplus and support a large population, but it's mostly about how many people pass through, how many new ideas they get.</p> <p>That's why, in researching cultures and history, I'll mostly just cover those two areas, Mesoamerica and Mesopotamia. Not to say other cultures have nothing to offer, but if your goal is syncretism of ideas, these two areas have been there, done that, and produced the best, most time-tested result. Cultures to the edges will only ever have a fraction of what the cultures in the center do, and while they may have a cool spin on the material, this book would be entirely too damn long if I included every single culture that ever existed. If your favorite part of the world wanted to be in this book, maybe it should have been more assertive during the tectonic shifts and grabbed a better spot, that's not my problem.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#ii-mesopotamia","title":"II: Mesopotamia","text":"<p>If we're talking about the Middle East, you know we're starting with Mesopotamia. It's the earliest known center of civilization, because it's located right at the bottleneck formed by the Red, Black, and Mediterranean Seas, you couldn't leave your continent back then without hitting Mesopotamia. It was the first melting pot, a filter that caught all the good ideas from three continents, and it's why the Mesopotamian Pantheon had a jaw-dropping three thousand gods in it. I thought it important I not write that number in digits, because you'd definitely have thought I accidentally put on an extra zero or two. Mesopotamia got started around 4000 BCE, and was mostly made up of Sumerians and Akkadians, with Elamites as neighbors to the east and Canaanites to the south, in the Middle Eastern deserts and hills.</p> <p>But as I was saying, Mesopotamia had about 3,000 gods. Don't worry, I won't tell you about all of them, just the important ones. In my opinion, \"important\" means \"ranks high enough to have a celestial body dedicated to them,\" but even there, it was variable by region. Mesopotamians all had different ideas on the Pantheon hierarchy, as you might expect with all those gods. Every city had their patron deity who they'd insist was chief of all the other gods, and they'd rank the other gods based on how friendly they were with the city the god came from. It was a real mess, but what I'm about to tell you here is what's generally accepted by the majority of scholars. If your favorite Mesopotamian god didn't make the cut, well, sorry, maybe he should have applied himself more and got himself a planet.</p> <p>Anu of Uruk, associated with the Equatorial Sky and luludanitu stone. This was the creator god.</p> <p>Enlil of Nippur, associated with the Northern Sky and lapis lazuli stone. God of wind, air, earth, and storms. He had the largest cult, and he's generally considered the benevolent and fatherly chief of gods.</p> <p>Enki of Eridu, associated with the Southern Sky and jasper stone. God of the subterranean freshwater ocean, magic, wisdom, and crafts.</p> <p>Marduk of Babylon, associated with Jupiter. He replaced Enlil as chief in 1900 BCE when Babylon rose to power under Hammurabi. His original role isn't well documented, but from his later roles, subtracting the ones he likely got as chief when he took over from Enlil, it was probably agriculture.</p> <p>Nabu of Borsippa and Kalhu, associated with Mercury. God of writing, he grew extremely popular by the late first millennium BCE, with a wide reach across nearby areas.</p> <p>Sin of Ur and Harran, god of the Moon.</p> <p>Utu of Sippar and Larsa, associated with the Sun. God of truth, justice, and morality.</p> <p>Ishtar of Uruk, associated with Venus, goddess of love, sex, and war. She was the most important and prominent female deity, and most myths involve her trying to usurp other gods.</p> <p>Ninurta of Nippur, Girsu, and Lagash, associated with Saturn. God of war and agriculture.</p> <p>Nergal of Kutha, associated with Mars. God of destruction, fire, war, and plague. Pretty much, if lots of people were dying, this was the guy doing it.</p> <p>Ereshkigal of Kutha, associated with the Hydra constellation. Goddess of the Underworld and death.</p> <p>Nanaya of Uruk and Kish, associated with the Corona Borealis. Goddess of love.</p> <p>Ninshubur of Akkil, associated with the Orion constellation. Sukkal, or advisor, of Ishtar, which was definitely not an enviable job. Ishtar was always stirring up trouble, and Ninshubur had to go get her out of it.</p> <p>These deities all had temples, most of them in several cities, and a statue of them in it. This statue would be seen as a kind of secondary body, or a conduit to the god itself. They'd be fed, clothed, worshipped, and they'd have their own carriage and boat on standby waiting to take them to battlefields or other places where you might want your god keeping an eye on things. The priests were also the rulers of the city, and it's not actually recorded anywhere, but you'd have to think the people got a little suspicious after a while that the gods always wanted whatever the King wanted. In Uruk, Cuneiform was invented, the very first writing system, which if you don't know is a really big deal for any organized civilization, but probably people were more excited about agriculture, the plow, the wheel, and irrigation, because those had some fairly tangible benefits in surplus food and trade, hallmarks of any advanced culture. Agriculture in particular is the reason big cities are even possible, why we don't run out of food.</p> <p>Around 2300 BCE, the Akkadians got an upper hand and started collecting Sumerian cities like they were baseball cards, making the world's first empire under King Sargon, right on the north tip of the Persian Gulf. They replaced Sumerian culture with their own, to what extent they were able, and this was where the first standardized system of weights and measures came in. Up till then, each city had their own measurement system, and if a few cities did a lot of trade together they might agree on one, but generally it was a real mess trying to figure out how much of anything there was, and the Akkadians didn't like that. They realized there was a lot of stuff in the world, and they wanted to count it all. The empire lasted about 180 years, until it was knocked down by invasions from the Gutian tribes and internal revolts from people who didn't like this new \"empire\" invention. The Guti kept control of Sumer for a good long while after that.</p> <p>The Sumerians did get back on top, though. Around 2100 BCE, under King Ur-Nammu, the Code of Ur-Nammu was written, which was pretty lucky since that title would have made no sense under any other king. It was the first known codified law, based on more than \"if you piss me off, I'll beat you till you wish you hadn't.\" It had it all, property rights, penalties, heavy emphasis on justice and restitution to victims of crimes, it was actually pretty groundbreaking for its time. Sumer had a great time for a while, with lots of writing, temples being built left and right, and an efficient administration. It barely lasted a century, though, before the Elamites invaded and sacked the city of Ur, but don't feel too bad for the Sumerians, they started it. The Amorites moved in and took over, and the Sumerians never really got another minute in the spotlight.</p> <p>Around 1900, the city of Babylon got in on this empire fad, and the Amorite King Hammurabi took just about all of Mesopotamia, writing the Code of Hammurabi, which was another striking coincidence in law code titling. This one was really heavy on different types of punishment for different crimes, and was the first one to establish the presumption of innocence. Marduk, patron god of Babylon, got his fifteen minutes of fame, going from D-list celebrity to Mesopotamia's headliner, taking over from Enlil as chief of the gods. Hammurabi's successors didn't do as well as he did, losing quite a bit of territory, and finally Babylon was sacked by Hittites around 1600 BCE. Babylonian culture was established, though, and was always the go-to in that region afterward.</p> <p>Around 1400 BCE, the Assyrians developed a military based on heavy cavalry use, iron weapons and armor, and innovations in siege warfare that led them to absolutely dominate the battlefield and establish the Assyrian Empire. Like the Romans who came later, the Assyrians knew the importance of roads and armies, and were extremely good at both. They exiled troublesome tribes in their new empire, set up provincial governors, and built the Library at Ninevah, which was a library in one of the cities around there, maybe Babylon, and is where modern people found the Epic of Gilgamesh, the oldest known literary work. They had the longest run, lasting 750 years before the Babylonians and Medes took Ninevah, which pretty much crushed what was left of the empire by then. Babylon was back on top.</p> <p>Nebuchadnezzar II rebuilt Babylon, probably with the help of at least a few other people, and built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, which, it should be noted, didn't actually hang. The Greek word translated there usually means \"overhanging,\" and has a broader meaning in Greek, so what we're really talking about here is a garden built on several different levels, which is a lot less impressive. Still, it must have been pretty cool to be one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Astronomy, math, and law were big in the new city, same as they'd always been. The military did a lot of raiding in the Levant to the south, and eventually tried taking on Egypt, which didn't work out at all, so they went back to the Levant and conquered Jerusalem instead, who'd been giving Babylon some trouble on the theory that Egypt would bail them out if it hit the fan, but that turned out not to be a solid bet at all. The King of Jerusalem was killed, his heir and a lot of other elites taken hostage, and the heir's uncle put on the throne.</p> <p>In the end, the Babylonian Empire only lasted about a century before it fell to the Persians. Cyrus the Great really wasn't a fan of guests, so he made a big point of returning all displaced people to their homes. The Persians played the empire game about as well as anyone, with standardized coinage, roads, and, under the rulers who came after Cyrus, a military that went to war with Greece, a decision that famously did not work out for them one bit. It was back and forth for about 50 years, the Persians would take some Greek cities, put some harsh tyrant in charge to teach them a lesson about obedience, and the Greeks would, every single time, fail to learn this lesson and send their new ruler packing. This heavily informs the story of Alexander the Great, who headed east with his Macedonian army in 330 BCE, about a century later, and put an end to the Persian Empire. Now, Alexander was a great fighter, but not a very good King, and he mostly lost all his territory to revolt pretty much as soon as the dust had settled behind him on the road he left on. But Mesopotamia was an exception, being ruled by one of his generals after the conquest, and lasting a good century as the Seleucid Empire.</p> <p>The Seleucid Empire was hugely successful for a while, taking all of Mesopotamia and a good chunk of the surrounding area, finally butting up against Egypt and India, neither of whom budged. Things were going so well, in fact, that around 200 BCE, King Antiochus decided it'd be a great idea to go conquer Greece and this upstart little republic they were allied with, some backwater punks who called themselves Rome. Of all the things that didn't work out for people in this history, this didn't work out the most. Antiochus got sent back home, short a useful portion of his military and owing a huge debt to Greece and Rome in return for being allowed to live. And while the Seleucids went on for some time after that, calling them an empire would be extremely generous. The Parthians knocked them down in pretty short order, and Persia was back in control.</p> <p>In 63 BCE, Pompey the Great, no relation to Cyrus the Great, as far as I could find, conquered Syria for Rome. With Rome's control established in the Levant and the Parthians in Mesopotamia, the stage was set for 250 years of war between them. The wars after, with the rest of Persia, would last another 500 years, past the fall of the Western Roman Empire and into the Byzantine Empire. It ended inconclusively, as both powers were then attacked by the early Muslim Caliphates, and they both decided they'd rather get conquered by these new guys than keep fighting each other, so they called off their war. But those are things to talk about in histories of the Byzantine Empire or the Caliphates. This is where we'll leave off for Mesopotamia, an area that left a strong legacy as the most influential of three continents, and the birthplace of civilization.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#iii-the-levant","title":"III: The Levant","text":"<p>On the Mediterranean coastline of Mesopotamia is what's called the Levant region. This is where the Canaanites lived, and where we'd see the Israelites a little later. The Canaanites' roots go way back, being between Egypt and Mesopotamia, they saw a lot of trade going back and forth, and some of their oldest cities, like Jericho and Byblos, are as old as anything you'd find anywhere else. Being right between two powerful, advanced cultures, it got the chance to absorb both of them, and by 3000 BCE they very solidly had their own separate culture going. Go forward to 2000 BCE, you see Hazor, Megiddo, Ugarit, and Sidon in full swing, and Amorites migrating in from the north added their own flavor to the mix.</p> <p>Like Mesopotamia, Canaan had an extremely long list of gods that really aren't worth going into unless you're a specialist in this area, and if you are, why are you reading my book to try to learn about it? I'm sure you can find a better source of information. This book being a high-altitude flyover, giving enough information to get on with but not much extra detail, the main Canaanite gods are:</p> <p>Ba'al, not actually a god, just a title that means lord, so the god they're always fighting in the early Old Testament could be just about anybody, really</p> <p>El, King of the Gods and god of creation</p> <p>Asherah, queen of the gods, wife of El</p> <p>Hadad, god of storms, sometimes King of the Gods instead of El, and probably the guy being referred to if someone says \"Ba'al\" without further context</p> <p>Shapash, goddess or god of the Sun</p> <p>Aglibol, god of the Moon</p> <p>Attar, god of the morning star, whose role, name, and gender pretty much depended on who you asked</p> <p>Arsu, god of the evening star and protector of caravans</p> <p>Arsay, goddess of the Underworld</p> <p>Ashima, goddess of fate</p> <p>Yahweh, storm god most likely originating in the southern Levant</p> <p>I bet you saw a familiar name on that list, right? That's right, it's the same guy. While Yahweh's origins aren't totally clear, it's known for sure that he was in the Canaanite Pantheon, and that the Israelites are a rogue sect of Canaanites. See, the thing is, the Israelites are genetically identical to the Canaanites, and lived in the same area, so if you're going to try to argue they're not from the same stock, you're going to have a hard time. I know they didn't cover this in Sunday School, but history is complicated and they only had you one day a week, they had to prioritize. The leading theory today, suggested by George Mendenhall and Norman Gottwald, both of whom have resumes as long as your arm, says the Israelites were Canaanite peasants who rejected the hierarchy, as people at the bottom of a hierarchy often do, took the god of their ancestors, and hit the road, rejecting the gods of their oppressors. And nobody's saying they were wrong, so unbunch your panties there, for all I know the Israelites just saw a deeper truth than their neighbors, so don't let my repeating historical facts set you off.</p> <p>Around 1200 BCE, right around the time the Israelites were fed up with the Canaanites' crap, Egyptian dominance was heavy in the area. Egypt was in its New Kingdom phase, and it really wanted more desert, because they didn't already have enough sand or something, so they took a lot of Canaan. The Amarna Letters come from this time, letters written between Pharaohs and rulers of Canaanite cities, where the people were slaves in service to the Egyptians. Now, scholars will say at this point that they weren't slaves, they were compulsory laborers. That's BS, and I'll tell you why.</p> <p>Imagine tomorrow morning, I come by your house bright and early with a bullwhip, and I tell you you're going to come do some yard work for me or else. By afternoon, your hands will be bleeding and blistered, you'll be hurting in all your muscles and joints, parts of you you never even knew were there, because I've got a lot of work backed up and I'll sure be taking the opportunity not to have to do it myself. And I'll be standing over there with my whip, calling over \"put your back into it, I don't have all day, I want to be done by suppertime!\" You say \"I can't take any more of this slave labor, you're going to kill me!\" That's when I'll say \"actually, this is just compulsory labor, I don't really own you.\" I bet you'd find the energy real quick to put your foot all the way up my ass, because who cares? That's not a distinction that needs to be made.</p> <p>So, the Canaanites were Egyptian slaves, making bricks, as seen in both archaeological records and the Bible, book of Exodus, and you can bet the peasants, who'd soon become the Israelites, were doing the heavy lifting on that project. Now, Egyptian records don't tell us what happened next, but they wouldn't, because the god-king thing was very important to the Pharaohs, and they didn't record anything embarrassing. The book of Exodus tells us God sent plagues, those being turning the Nile to blood, an infestation of frogs, then flies, then mass death of the livestock, then boils, thunderstorm, locusts, three days of darkness, and wrapping it up with death of the firstborn. Now, I can't tell you Moses definitely went and talked to Pharaoh. I can't tell you God sent plagues. But I can tell you, with zero shred of doubt, something poisoned the Nile and wrecked everybody's week.</p> <p>Why am I so sure? Because these plagues start with the Nile being bad, and while the rest of them are presented as separate events, they're exactly what would happen if the water got a heavy dose of something unpleasant. Frogs get the hell out of there, flies are everywhere, because suddenly there's a lot of extra dead bodies from the bad water, dead livestock, dead people. There's a certain algae bloom that's suggested pretty often here, that would turn the Nile red, like blood, and maybe a volcanic eruption nearby to cover the three days of darkness. I don't know about those, it could easily be those are just extra dramatic touches, but I will tell you absolutely, the Nile got a heavy dose of poison, and I believe it specifically because that's not the story the Bible's selling, but it fits like a glove. You can say God did it or not, and Moses was involved or he wasn't, but the part about the Nile definitely happened.</p> <p>Now, I'm not saying that event and what followed are the reason the Israelites got cut loose. Truth is, Egypt had a lot going on. It was the end of the 19th Dynasty, Ramesses II had just died, there was a civil war, lots of Pharaohs coming and going, and it's entirely possible some less important projects, like brickmaking in Canaan, fell through the cracks. While we can't say for sure Exodus happened in this time, empires have to choose priorities pretty often, so you can pretty much pick any year you want, the Egyptians would have had a good reason not to be paying too much attention over there. Add to that, the major players in the Levant had just collapsed, those being the Hittites and Mycenaeans, primarily. So with authority a little nebulous, the main threats suddenly not so scary, and having just been forced to work a big construction project against their will, that would make the perfect time for the Israelites to say \"you know what, it's been fun, but it's mostly been the opposite of that, bye,\" and split off from the Canaanites, heading off into the hills.</p> <p>It's not too surprising the Israelites started off as an egalitarian culture. They'd just left a society with strict social hierarchy, they weren't looking to copy it, so when the Bible says they had no kings, well, I'm inclined to believe it. It didn't last very long, because there's always some prick who wants to be the top dog, egalitarianism just doesn't ever last, but I'm sure it was nice for a while. Biblically, the Israelites demanded a king, wouldn't be dissuaded, so God gave in, and Saul was so dead set against being crowned that he went and hid, but they found him and forced it on him. And my answer to that is yeah, that's what I'd say too if I schemed my way to the top of my tribe and didn't want future generations to know what a colossal prick I was.</p> <p>Regardless, over the next few centuries, the Canaanite culture evolved, they became the Phoenicians, spreading all over the Mediterranean, becoming master sailors and spreading their alphabet, the root of the Greek and Latin characters, and the Philistines moved in toward the south, near Egypt. The Israelites, and later the Judahites, made their kingdoms in the highlands, and that's when we're to believe Joshua conquered Canaan. Now, I'm not here to tell you the Bible isn't true, but I'm definitely here to tell you Jericho had no wall at the time Joshua blew his trumpet, and hadn't for about 200 years, and this if you take the word of tradition, that this happened around 1400 BCE. That wall was knocked down in 1600 BCE, probably by an earthquake, and modern scholars say the Israelites didn't even split from the Canaanites till 1200 BCE, so by that math, we're looking at around 500 years with no wall, so how would Joshua knock it down, either way? Could be an honest mistake, maybe he blew his trumpet before he really got a good look, and then when he saw there was no wall he figured it'd worked, but it is an archaeological fact that Jericho hadn't had a wall in centuries by the time this was supposedly happening, and Ai and Jericho were never conquered anywhere near the necessary timeframe. But, okay. I'll believe the Bible over archaeology, why not, Joshua 10:40 says he killed every last person in Canaan, which really seems unethical to me, but God was okay with it just this once.</p> <p>But let's not harp on that, applying modern morality to ancient myth, because the truth is no mythology or history consistently holds up to morality as it shifts from one generation to the next. Let's talk instead about the theological shift that happened around 550 BCE, when Jerusalem was conquered by Babylon, and all the Jewish elites were shuttled off to be held hostage. It's only after the exile to Babylon that God becomes not the supreme god, but the only one. Check out Exodus 15:11, Exodus 20:3, Deuteronomy 5:7, Deuteronomy 6:14-15, Deuteronomy 32:8-9, Psalm 82:1, Psalm 86:8, Psalm 95:3, Psalm 97:7, Exodus 34:14, 1 Kings 8:23, Jeremiah 10:11, read all of them, with the knowledge that Yahweh in the Canaanite Pantheon is an unassailable historical fact, and tell me you really believe these verses mean to imply other gods straight up do not exist. These verses show competition with and intolerance of other gods, and you can try to twist it into being some metaphor if you really want to, but that's not going to change what the Bible actually says.</p> <p>Course, there are some verses that say God is the only one who exists, and those are found after the royalty of Jerusalem were exposed to Zoroastrianism in Babylon. During and after Babylon, you start finding talk of a divine cosmic plan, Satan as the ultimate bad guy, reward and punishment based afterlife, angelology, and monotheism rather than henotheism, which we just talked about, the belief that other gods exist but are forbidden. You go on, find me any of that in the older books. This was the root of the split between the Pharisees and Saducees, the Saducees kept the old law and old beliefs, and the Pharisees, being made up of the royalty and elite, had plenty of time to talk about Zoroastrianism on their vacation in Babylon and decided it made a lot of sense. And now that they had Heaven and Hell to worry about, they decided, in their words, to build a fence around the Torah, making a bunch of extra rules so nobody could ever even come close to breaking a real commandment. Can't take chances with your eternal soul, can you?</p> <p>But that's not to say the new beliefs are wrong. Maybe God didn't say lots of things in explicit terms, that doesn't mean it's not true. You can't expect him to tell you about every atom of the Universe, and even if something's important, he may have a very good reason to keep it from you. Adam and Eve had less knowledge in the Garden, but they were definitely happier than most of us today. Sometimes God keeps his people ignorant on purpose, then some Babylonian named Zoroaster or a snake in a tree comes along and screws the whole thing up. In the end, all I can do is throw you the facts, you're the only one who can decide what they mean to you.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#part-three-mythology","title":"Part Three: Mythology","text":""},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#i-sitcoms-in-sandals","title":"I: Sitcoms in Sandals","text":"<p>In the poet Lawrence David's epic \"Seinfeld,\" one of the great heroes of the piece, Kramer, enters a dining establishment specializing in soup and requests a bowl of soup. The owner, known for his strict demeanor, refuses, stating \"no soup for you.\" Kramer leaves without obtaining soup.</p> <p>Do you think Seinfeld would have gotten anywhere if it were written like that? Course not, I just stripped all the life out of it, everything that made it worthwhile. But we do it with mythology all the time, we take out everything that made people ever want to hear the story in the first place, and we pride ourselves on knowing which props were different in the cut from camera A to camera B, and God forbid anyone say the props from camera B are canon, A is the only one that matters, B is derivative trash. We argue about who REALLY wrote the scene, and whether it was inserted later. I won't lie, I fall into the same trap myself from time to time, but this is just not the way myths were meant to be seen. You know why there's continuity errors? Because like Larry David, Homer and Shakespeare and Virgil were just trying to tell a damn story, they didn't expect you to be here centuries later picking apart the set dressing for hidden meaning.</p> <p>Would you think it was impressive if someone could list every X-Files monster in order of appearance, had strong opinions about whether Scully's cross necklace changed size, and insisted only episodes written by Chris Carter count? Course not, that's not scholarship, that's trivia night. So why do you think I'd be impressed you can do the same thing with Taoist myths? That's some real \"forest for the trees\" stuff there, if someone watched House of the Dragon and those kinds of details were their takeaway, you'd think they must have OCD on an epic scale. Modern study of ancient mythology is like reconstructing the apartment from Big Bang Theory down to the tiniest detail, then some guy comes out and reads you a summary of a scene in monotone, and everybody slaps each other on the back, \"congratulations on being geniuses, guys, we did it!\" To be totally fair, though, I don't think that would be any less funny than the average Big Bang Theory scene.</p> <p>\"But it's a window into the lives of the people of the time,\" the pedants wail, desperate to justify themselves. Sure, in the same way we can learn about the 90s through The Sopranos and the early 2000s from Breaking Bad, which is to say kind of, barely. But it also ignores a lot of facts, like how Tony Soprano would have been tried, convicted, and sentenced in season 1 for all the crimes he committed without bothering to put on some damn gloves or a mask. His fingerprints were all over multiple crime scenes, his face was clearly seen all the time, do you think this story really gives you insight into the world of the time? Same way with mythology. It's a story, not a documentary, and if you think the writers of centuries ago had a stricter dedication to realism than writers today, then you probably don't understand mythology as well as you think.</p> <p>Don't get me wrong, I don't hate mythology, I love it, and there really are things to learn about history, storytelling, and cultural attitudes, but too often it gets bogged down in pseudointellectualism and pedantry. Arguing about the mythological canon is equal, intellectually, to arguing about whether Han or Greedo shot first, one of those arguments just has better PR. This isn't a call to leave mythology behind, it's a call to stop focusing on the wrong things as a signal to other people that you're really, really smart, because to people who really know mythology, you're signalling the opposite. If the original authors watched Clash of the Titans or American Gods, they'd applaud harder than anyone, because that's what the story is supposed to be, entertainment. The fact that you know the minute details of the exact version of the story that one single author wrote down doesn't mean you know the \"right version,\" it means you know what Homer thought his audience would like. And while that tells you something about both Homer and Greece at that time, I ask you, does that elevate it to the level of holy scripture, and make those who change it heretics?</p> <p>Look, I love mythology as much as anyone. At the time of this writing, I'm in the middle of a deep dive of the Torah, picking it apart to try to piece together the real history of the Israelites and lost Levantine mythology, so before you come at me in a nerd duel, just know I'm armed. I'm just saying get some perspective on the thing. If you think Iliad is better, objectively, than Deadwood, or Romeo and Juliet is better than Game of Thrones, you've missed the point of it. And if you think stripping a story down to its bare, lifeless facts makes it better, Shakespeare is spinning like a drill bit in his grave right now.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-metal/#ii-mythological-evolution","title":"II: Mythological Evolution","text":"<p>One of the earliest gods was the Sun. Early man picked up pretty quick that moving around at night got his friends eaten and didn't result in finding food too often, so the Sun was most likely our first god, protecting us from predators and bringing us success in our hunting and gathering days. Every culture, everywhere worshipped the Sun at some point, it's the cultural touchstone we know we'll find anywhere we look. We can also find stories of beings not too different from us, some being big, mean brutes who'd beat us up if we looked at them sideways, and some being tricky little bastards who'd distract us and steal our stuff while we weren't looking. Those became giants, trolls, ogres, leprechauns, elves, all kinds of stuff in our stories, but were probably really just other primates in the original versions. If you think about it, that's what life in Africa must have been like for early humans, surrounded by things that kind of look like us, but are either much bigger or much smaller, and we didn't always play nice together.</p> <p>But back to gods, after the Sun, they'd be animistic. They'd be animals, mountains, rivers, whatever, and these gods weren't that powerful. The Bear God, obviously, is fairly limited, but since you can't beat him up, you appease him with respect and offerings so he doesn't come eat your village. That's what a god was, early on, a thing you can't beat up, but whose favor or forbearance you needed, like large predators, rain, really any number of things. And as these people hit their geographical bottlenecks, they'd bring their gods along for the ride. The idea of these gods would mingle with the local gods, and several things might happen.</p> <p>First possibility, the locals might think your god is a really good idea, and they'd bring some version of it into their Pantheon, with his position in the hierarchy being determined by how important your culture was to the local culture, and mostly by which culture could beat up the other. Or they might have a god who's just like yours, so you all agree it's just the same guy under a different name. Both ways were the root of extensive polytheism seen in ancient cultures, and the second possibility is where gods started to take a recognizable form. See, these similar gods weren't exact copies, so they might keep the same main power, but then they'd get a ton of lesser powers as footnotes, and that's what evolved Steve, God of Bears, into Steve, God of Justice, Divine Order, Balance, and Bears. That's why Ra became Amun-Ra, why Marduk took the roles of older Mesopotamian gods, why if you look up the Greco-Roman gods they come with the domains everyone knows, and then a list of footnotes as long as your arm. Once the ancient people started merging gods together based on each being a different facet of the whole, you can see why monotheism was the next step.</p> <p>It's absolutely logical, if you think about it. The next step after lumping together gods with similar domains and powers was always going to be lumping together the ones who aren't similar at all, but are on the same team. Why shouldn't Mars, revered God of War, just be the aspect of Jupiter, God of Justice, when there's divine smiting to be done? Once you've introduced multiple facets to a god's domain, why not grab them all? The Olympian Gods can just be Olympus, one god with twelve facets. Now, that didn't actually happen, as far as I know, but it's the idea behind having a single god, like the Zoroastrians or the Jewish people and their descendant religions.</p> <p>So what's the point here? Am I saying there are no gods, and it's all just the growth and evolution of the category \"things we can't beat up?\" Course not, I believe one hundred percent that ancient people were accidentally stumbling into contact with higher dimensions, and that's why magic, spirits, and gods have so much similarity across cultures, and why highly advanced scientific concepts have started backing these things up, and you'll never talk me out of it. I'm just saying don't be overly attached to the specific mythology behind your god, because I guarantee you one hundred percent that is not his original factory packaging. But do you really care? If your ritual to invoke Zeus connects you to a spirit who cares about justice, and the stories about Zeus let you understand better how to interact with this spirit and what to expect from it, do you really care if he never killed Cronos? Seems to me you'd be focusing on the wrong thing there.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/","title":"The Book of Water","text":"<p>[[toc]]</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>I want to tell you all how I came to be here today, writing this book. For most of my life, I was an Atheist. I never was all that solid with God, because when I was around 3 or 4, I convinced myself my Dad was going to Hell. He drank, smoke, cussed, and I didn't have a real firm grip on the difference between breaking rules and sinning, so I pretty much considered it a done deal, that when he died he'd go to Hell, and I was bound and determined to go with him. I eventually grew out of that, just in time to discover the really early stages of social media that we had back in the early 2000s. I was about 13, and for those of you that don't know, the Internet is just packed full of Atheists. Now, it had never occurred to me to ask whether God was actually real in all my 13 years, but it turned out every time I got in an argument with somebody about which side made more sense, I'd get my argument ripped to shreds and just feel like an absolute fool.</p> <p>So that was it, I was sold, and I lived the next 20 years shooting down any mention of God or magic just the way I'd learned from having it done to me. I don't know if any of you have ever tried it, but it's real easy to be an Atheist. You win every argument, you just ask \"where's the proof,\" and since God isn't going to come down and do a miracle then and there, you win! So I got to live my life without any worry about rules. I spent my 20s drunk all the time, did drugs a little, sold drugs a lot, and there were some other things I did that I probably shouldn't get into right here and now.</p> <p>And I won't stand here and say I never had any fun. Well, jail wasn't fun. Probation wasn't fun. Knowing I was almost always one wrong move from a double-digit prison stay wasn't fun. But you know, in between all that, there were some times I enjoyed. But it was empty. I had no real friends, I had no life to speak of, nothing was worthwhile.</p> <p>And I'm not going to tell you that drove me back to God, because it didn't. What did it was that I started looking into magic. Not because I was especially interested, but because I thought selling magic charms and stuff might be a good way to make a living by ripping people off. So I spent a while looking into Vodou, Hoodoo, European Dark Ages magic, anything I could think of or get my hands on. And what really struck me was how similar it all was. You'd think magic, being just made-up stuff, would have a wide range, because if it doesn't have to be real, well, it can be anything, right? You'd be wrong.</p> <p>That's when I looped speculative physics into this Universalist branch of magic I was inventing. I don't know how much any of you know about that, string theory, quantum fields, higher dimensions, all that, but let me tell you, it made a believer out of this former Atheist. The more I looked into science, not just the baseline, obvious stuff everybody can see, but the real mechanism of the Universe, I came to see magic wasn't that much of a leap after all. In fact, most of the time, once you've got the advanced physics concepts, magic is the logical next step. Brass tacks, magic is real, but I won't ask you to believe that just yet, because I'm not going to explain it to you till later.</p> <p>Even with that, though, I still didn't believe in God. Didn't even really occur to me. I had a couple decades under my belt of not really thinking about God, and I guess I was deep in the habit. What finally tipped me was really the dumbest thing. I was still working on my magic system, and wanted to bring Angelology into the mix, not because I believed in Angels, but as a metaphor, try to explain concepts to people in an easy, simple way they'd understand, but more importantly, I was copying cool stuff I'd seen in a lot of European Dark Ages magic. I had no intention of really connecting it to God, though, and in fact was going to leave him out and ONLY bring in the Angels.</p> <p>Well, let me tell you, I went to start connecting Christianity to my system, and wham! It slid right in, like it was made specially for that. This whole complex web of advanced science and metaphysics, God slid right on in like it was intended all along, even though I'd never spared him a thought the whole time I was making it. If that's not proof of God, I don't know what is, that he'd just fit so perfectly, so naturally, into a model of the Universe that had nothing to do with him. Now, I won't tell you all the traditional views went along with him, but I will tell you he fit without contradicting Scripture one single time. If you're real stuck on tradition, you probably won't like my views on God, but you won't be able to pull a verse to prove I'm wrong, not from the Torah, the Bible, or the Quran.</p> <p>So I told you all that to tell you this: Anyone who thinks the idea of God doesn't make sense from a scientific standpoint doesn't know as much science as they think they do. We can't prove God, but we know enough about how the Universe works that we know he makes perfect sense as a part of it. What follows here is my entire theory as relates to tradition, religion, and general supernatural phenomena. It won't click into the traditions of your religion, but I can say with confidence it won't contradict any of your scripture, the real, actual words of your deity or deities.</p> <p>The focus here will be on Hinduism and the God of Abraham, because those are the most common religious views in the world today, and the ways of folding them together will address any other religion you might believe in. Polytheists have never had trouble fitting into Hinduism, and if you're a monotheist, most of the view on the Abrahamic God should speak to you just as well as the Christian, Muslim, and Jewish people, even though I'm sure the scriptural quotations won't apply. Not to leave anyone out, or to say anyone's god is less important, but if I covered every god who ever existed this would be a much longer book. Between Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Atheism, whose proponents really aren't going to find this book helpful no matter which gods I include, we've got, by most recent stats, 93% of the world covered. To the other 7%, or to anyone not convinced by my arguments, contact me through the website, we can talk about religion and spirits all day long.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#part-one-marzod","title":"Part One: Marzod","text":""},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#i-everything-is-everything","title":"I: Everything is Everything","text":"<p>As a concept, you can find Marzod all over the world under different names. China, Japan, India, Polynesia, Tibet, Greece, and South America, and sure, some of them got the idea from each other, but some got the idea all by themselves. Untold billions of people all through history describe the basic concept of an interconnected life force. Now, I've never seen five people agree on a lunch order, so looking for this many people to agree on the specifics of the force of life is pretty optimistic, of course there are differences. But at the core, the starting point is it's cosmic energy, and it exists inside every living thing, linking them together, despite seeming to be different.</p> <p>Where the systems overlap, they tell us there's a force that flows through the body and cosmos. A lot of the systems say it travels through channels and accumulates at certain points, like an electrical circuit with a bunch of light bulbs. On the large scale, it flows through the Universe and gathers at certain points, like Earth, but let's focus on the small scale, the body. In the body, it's linked to health and function of body and mind, keeping them running as they should, and if they take damage, the force's flow is affected. Better alignment with the harmony of the Universe makes it do its work better. It's the force that allows connection between people that goes deeper than their ability to affect our physical lives, because the energy is all part of a whole, and all living things are interconnected. It can be in locations and objects based on their history or connection to divinity.</p> <p>But then the beliefs start to split off from each other. In India, some Tantric beliefs split this force into two parts, Shiva, the thought, and Shakti, action. Hindu Kundalini says the energy lives at the base of the spine, and their practices are supposed to make it travel up to your brain. In Polynesia, Mana isn't really yours, it's something you gain or lose based on divine favor. Indian Prana and Tibetan Lung both focus on breath work to maintain the force, breathing in different patterns to make it flow better, while in China they say acupuncture stimulates certain nodes in the body where Qi gathers, and lots of Asian cultures use pressure therapy on the same theory, that the force is backed up in certain nodes. Greek Logos, or what later Western occultists called Aether, Quechuan Kawsay, Japanese Ki, Indian Brahman and Atman, just about everybody has something that fits the description of a cosmic, interconnected force that's doing inside your body what it's doing in the Universe.</p> <p>So the common thread is there seems to be a force, which I call Marzod so as not to get bogged down in any baggage that comes along with the other names. It can't be seen, felt, or quantified, but it's what makes life alive. Where seed and egg come together, Marzod is the third, intangible piece that creates a new life, and if you're interested in the scientific side, the next book in this series will get into why this force can't be seen. Brass tacks, it exists on another plane that we're not equipped to perceive. Spirits are waves in an ocean that stretches through time and space, and what happens to one spirit ripples through and hits them all. Sometimes, people can connect their spirits to the greater whole, get past the individual they think they are, and that opens the door to telekinesis, telepathy, and prophecy, because you can see and do things from the perspective of another spirit across space and time.</p> <p>Once it's exposed to influences, Marzod evolves to deal with its environment. Spirits start off the same, but develop differences, and the more different spirits are from each other, the weaker the connection, and the less influence they have on each other. There's a kind of convergent evolution that happens, spirits that prey on others will be in the same group, spirits that are only looking for shallow pleasures are in another, and it's a lot harder to connect across groups than inside them. I combined the elemental system of the Greeks (Water, Fire, Earth, Air, Aether) with the Chinese system (Water, Metal, Earth, Fire, Wood), because neither seemed to really capture the full scope, sorting different personalities into either of those systems seemed to always land \u201cclose enough\u201d rather than giving a reliable answer. With Fire, Earth, and Water being mostly the same in both, and Aether just being one of the names of Marzod, I added Air, Wood, and Metal, and ended with seven elements, whose traits are mostly the traits assigned by the two parent systems, with a few reasonable extrapolations thrown in. Course, any sorting system accounts for more differences when you add more categories, it's always a balance between precision and ease of use, so you can always draw more lines if you think my system generalizes too much.</p> <p>Marzod: Neutral, united, undifferentiated</p> <p>Water: Compassionate, impulsive, social, content</p> <p>Earth: Compassionate, structured, social, content</p> <p>Metal: Dispassionate, structured, solitary, content</p> <p>Air: Dispassionate, impulsive, solitary, ambitious</p> <p>Wood: Predatory, structured, social, ambitious</p> <p>Fire: Predatory, impulsive, solitary, ambitious</p> <p>Whichever one you are, the farther another spirit is from your spot on the chain, the less you can communicate with it, because difference blocks communication. If you're a Fire spirit, talking to other Fire is no problem at all, and you can probably talk to Wood and maybe Air. With practice you might even stretch it to Metal and Earth, but there's no way, no how you will ever talk to Marzod or Water spirits. That many steps down the chain just can't happen, you're on totally different wavelengths. Look at Abrahamic Angels and Demons, Zoroastrian Light and Shadow beings, Hindu Asuras and Devas, Shinto Kami and Kegare, in all cases, the weaker spirit, the one with a smaller network of friends linked to it, just nopes right on out of the situation when its opposite shows up. Meanwhile, I couldn't possibly list for you all the cultures that have spirits sharing a body symbiotically, from Vodun and its descendants, to the shamanistic beliefs of any culture you care to name, to spirit mediums, you see like-minded spirits sharing a body with no problem at all. But like Marzod itself, I'm not saying all the systems are exactly the same, just showing the thread that runs through them.</p> <p>Marzod is the name of the original, unevolved, neutral energy, but also the general name for any of its subdivisions. Water, Fire, Metal, they're all still Marzod, just like all colors are still light. They look different, but at the core they're made of the same thing. Any of them can attach to a new life, as long as the Marzod isn't already attached to an identity. The nature of the life has some effect too. While a human can be any element, you'll never see a rattlesnake that's aligned with Water, it's not within their abilities to be compassionate, they're not social animals.</p> <p>When a person dies, their spirit is usually reabsorbed into the whole, but sometimes it's left behind as a ghost. The person carried this spirit, this piece of a whole, all through their lives, and left an imprint of themselves on it. It's left to wander around on Earth, and it can possess a new body, but it can't really live in it, because a spirit who already has an identity can't go off and become someone else, its being wrapped up in its identity is the whole reason it's still here. So sure, it can overpower another spirit and puppet its body around, but it can't really belong there. It can't attach to the new identity, because it's still the old one. Given time, maybe it learns to let go, but until then, it's stuck.</p> <p>Marzod started off fully interconnected, with limitless potential, but it changed as it responded to its environment. Those changes set up all kinds of roadblocks on what spirits it could talk to, what lives it could have, what it would be like. From the ability to do anything, it narrowed it down to a single avenue, forced down a path, a product of its own self-imposed limits. Isn't that true of all of us? Most of the things you can't do are because of the choices you made.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#ii-of-ghosts-and-gods","title":"II: Of Ghosts and Gods","text":"<p>Greek, Norse, Daoist, Mayan, they've got plenty of differences, but one thing they all have in common is sacrifices of food and alcohol to the gods, accompanied by rituals and requests. While the specific practices are different, the core of the process is the same. Now look to the Yoruba culture, ancient China, ancient Egypt, and other cultures who have ancestor worship, the offerings to ghosts and gods are the same, usually alcohol, sugar, and fat, with a ritual and a request. That overlap suggests ancient cultures didn't usually draw hard lines between ghosts and gods, those came later. Now, I know what you're thinking, some gods claim to be all-powerful, but when do you ever see them backing up all that talk? Look through your favorite holy book or mythology, outside of the creation and apocalypse stories, when do they ever do anything that affects more than a few people? Sometimes they'll strain themselves and do a city or two, but they're never doing anything that has any effect outside of the particular region they're working with, and if you think they have, I'd like to see how your favorite myth with global impact affected another continent, if you wouldn't mind showing me.</p> <p>That's why I say no matter who your favorite god is, he's just a local spirit with a power surplus and an ego, full of talk about what he did when nobody was watching and what hes going to do aaaaaany day now, just you watch. The difference between god and ghost is only the amount of energy they've got on hand to waste on making things happen. That suggests to me that there's the same core, Marzod, and without a body to live in, they draw energy to themselves. That's why they screw with electricity, why light gets a little strange around them, why they suck all the heat out of a room, why they act the way all the stories say they do. They draw in energy in all forms.</p> <p>So why doesn't a ghost go drink the Sun and become a god? Why do they go where it's cold, dark, and quiet, no energy anywhere? Why have some ancient cultures been able to drive spirits off with drums and bonfires, while others attract them with the same thing? It's because it's not the presence of energy, it's the amount, compared to the power of the spirit you're dealing with. Too much outside energy all at once overwhelms a weak spirit, like radio waves getting drowned out by a stronger transmission. They need to absorb energy gradually, build up their tolerance before they can handle big blasts of it. They need time to process the energy into a form that's more stable for them.</p> <p>What really separates a ghost from a god is this: A spirit focused on serving another spirit's needs is effectively adding itself to the master spirit. They're all connected anyway, all it takes is for one of them to see the other as master, and they establish a conduit. The master spirit draws on the energy of its followers. Now imagine the power of a spirit when he's got the collected energy of hundreds, thousands, millions of spirits at hand. As long as all its followers are on the same page, bending their will to his, he\u2019s got massive potential.</p> <p>Far as most of Hinduism goes, a ghost and a god being the same is no surprise at all, since every single thing in reality is a different manifestation of Brahman, so this idea just falls right in line. Will it surprise you at all to know the Bible agrees? Genesis 1:26-27 and Ephesians 4:24 both reference man being made in God's image, and I don't think it means the flesh and blood body. We've got the same thing in Sahih Muslim Hadith 2841, and Surah Sad 38:72, Surah Al-Hijr 15:29, and Surah As-Sajda 32:9 all say Allah breathed into man his spirit. Now, interpretation of Scripture is always subjective, and Islam outright rejects my reading here, but their objection is based in tradition, not Scripture. It's a difference of opinion, not a provable fact. And while knowing every twig of a particular tree is a valuable thing, you have to step back and look at the forest if you really want to understand trees.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#iii-piano-man","title":"III: Piano Man","text":"<p>\"There's no way you could play a C chord on that thing!\" the pianist screams.</p> <p>\"You're one to talk, yours doesn't even have strings,\" the guitarist snaps back.</p> <p>\"Did you guys forget your bows?\" the fiddler asks, confused.</p> <p>Sounds ridiculous, right? All these musicians can play just fine, but they're so wrapped up in their specific instruments they forgot the basics. They all hit the same notes, they can play the same songs, but they can't see past the logistics of the instruments. Working with spirits is no different. There's always that one guy who says \"no, no, you don't use that symbol, it's this one, and you're praying all wrong,\" and wouldn't you know it, it\u2019s always his own culture that's got it right, whether he's saying Latin is God's language or the path to Heaven is in proper pronunciation of Sanskrit. My answer is, well, aren't you lucky you were born into the one and only culture in the time and space of this whole planet that knew what the hell they were doing, while the thousand others are only fooling themselves? Never play the lottery, buddy, you used up all your luck already on that one move.</p> <p>Now, there's something to be said for mastering a specific practice, but you only have so much bandwidth. Do you want to go broad, or deep? A one-man band can play any instrument, but he'll never be as good at any of them as someone who mastered just one thing. So start broad, the basics of anything all live near each other. If you learn the basics of the fiddle, you're also learning things that translate to the cello, you're cutting through the noise to find the general principles that show up everywhere. You can specialize later, once you've learned the difference between fluff and substance.</p> <p>In spirit work, the substance comes down to some basic elements, notes you can play no matter what instrument you're working with. First, you get the spirit's attention, using time, place, rituals, or props. Second, show some respect, if you go around acting like a prick nobody wants to talk to you, alive or dead. Third, give up something of value to establish a bond, ancient cultures used food, but in a world where most of us have full fridges, that doesn't mean as much. Fourth, you can ask for something. The rest is just tradition that varies from one culture to the next, and it's not useless, exactly, but anything that follows the same tune should work fine. If you play Beethoven's Fifth note for note on a tissue box with rubber bands on it, what kind of prick is going to tell you you're doing it wrong?</p> <p>The main thing that I think gets in the way is the spoken word. As humans, we rely on it, we build our whole lives around it, but everything that's alive has a spirit, and we're in the minority as far as having complex vocal communication. That's clearly not how spirits talk. We're jabbering away, skipping the focus and connection that would actually help us along here, and the spirit may not even realize we're trying to say anything. So is it body language, then? That's how animals communicate, but you're going to have a hard time reading body language from something that has no body.</p> <p>The key here is in the nature of Marzod, everything is one, but imagines itself different. All you need to do is recognize that, while circumstances caused you to manifest differently, you and the other spirit are the same thing. You're waves in the ocean, so stop thinking like a wave, think like the ocean. The first step is to shut the hell up, and the second is to focus on your connection to the spirit or spirits, not run around distracted like a puppy chasing its tail. Third, when you feel like you've established communication, offer them something, and fourth, you can try to get them to do something for you. Do this often enough, the spirits will be listening for you, you'll get to know a few regulars. If you get a good handle on what you're doing, you'll be playing concerts for a packed house, and the spirits will be yelling for an encore.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#iv-as-below-so-above","title":"IV: As Below, So Above","text":"<p>Ask the Norse, Egyptians, Mayans, Hindu, hell, ask most ancient cultures. None of them thought the soul was just one thing, it's a collection of parts. Now, what exactly those parts are, and how many, depends on who you ask, but mostly, you'll have your life force, your personality, your ascended self, and any of those might be split off into different specialties, like the Egyptians splitting your name, personality, and emotions into Ren, Ba, and Ib. Depending on which system you like, you're a combination of anywhere from one to ten souls. And that's not the end of the story.</p> <p>See, we're the sum of our parts, but we're also parts making a different sum one level up, and those parts go on to sum into something else higher up, until it all coalesces into one, Marzod. You're sort of a blend of your soul parts, who live on a lower plane, then you and several other people are the soul parts of a being on a higher plane. These are your soulmates, the people you're drawn to, who you seem to connect with for no reason at all. A lot of the time you'll be similar, for the same reason two leaves from the same tree look alike, other times you might be complete opposites, but you still feel a deep bond that won't let go. Then there are weaker bonds, maybe you're not forming the same higher being one level up, but those two higher beings are part of the same one on the level above them, so you're soul cousins instead of soul siblings. The more generations up your divergence is, the harder it is to form a bond.</p> <p>You ever feel like you just couldn't ditch somebody? No matter how long you were without them, you'd think about them constantly, and the second you saw them again it was like no time had passed. Then there's other people you couldn't make friends with no matter how hard you tried. Well, unless you needed to switch brands of deodorant or something, this is why. We're all connected, but some connections are farther up the chain than others. Somebody that knows what they're doing can swim right up the chain and find the right junction, but most people haven't trained their awareness to that point yet.</p> <p>This could be what schizophrenia is, and I say \u201ccould be\u201d because I've never experienced it for myself. Of course there are physical symptoms, your hardware is pushing your software in strange new ways, but those voices might just be other souls, and they can hear you too, and when all of you are amped up and thinking all the others are evil, well, it creates a tense situation, same as you'd be tense if your roommate kept screaming that you're a demon. Historically, in a lot of cultures, they saw those voices as being friendly and helpful spirits, they're not trying to get the person to do anything bad. It's everybody stressing everybody out that turns it into a bad situation for all of them. If you could all just take your paranoia down a notch, I'm sure you could all work it out. The flip side, of course, is some people are just pricks, and in that case you should look into adjusting your hardware to shut them out.</p> <p>Dreams are the same. You ever notice how you're not really you in your dreams? You don't act the same, you don't think the same, you don't move the same. Well, that's because it's not you. You're seeing what another soul is seeing, but you're putting your own life over it, like duct-taping pictures of yourself and all your friends over the people who are really there. You're so attached to being you that you can't see what's really happening, and you wonder why nothing makes sense. It's because you're not supposed to be the main character in someone else's thoughts.</p> <p>The farther you go up the soul chain, the more powerful the perspective. The next step up can see, do, and understand more, and once you're seeing things from a higher plane, you can do things on the lower plane that look like miracles.

Well, I'm here to set you straight. There's only one sin, and the rest are more what you'd call guidelines. The Sin, singular, is the disruption of harmony, the state of peace and productivity within yourself, your community, and with God. Now, the catch is, it takes many forms, but this Sin is the only thing God cares about stopping.</p> <p>First form of the Sin, singular, is harm of others. It's shown in any number of commandments, and I won't list them because you already know it, God doesn't want people hurting each other. The only exception here is when the person themselves is a bigger threat to harmony than hurting them would be. If they've hurt someone, if they're disrespectful of God, if they themselves are committing the Sin in a major way, then you\u2019re generally allowed to do whatever it takes to stop them, showing God never cared about this form of the Sin in particular, he cares about the bottom line, stopping the Sin in general. Now, that's not a free pass to do harm whenever you think you've got an excuse. All harm is disruptive, it's just that sometimes one disruption is preferable to another, if one has to happen. For it to be a just response, harm to the person must be less disruptive than what they're doing, and it has to be the only way to stop them.</p> <p>Second form of the Sin is harm to self. When you get sick or injured, other members of the community have to work harder, picking up your slack. This was the basis of all those laws of diet and hygiene God imposed on the Jewish and Islamic people, that you're to stay healthy and fully functional so you can provide the most benefit to your community. There's also a major subclause to this one, on counterproductive attitude. If you're arrogant or hostile or generally a prick, you're hard to work with, you disrupt harmony, and God hates when people commit the Sin.</p> <p>Third form of the Sin is disruption of community standards. Now, every community rule isn't sacred, you're not going to Hell for littering, smoking, or wearing white after Labor Day, I'm talking about the real stuff, the rules that go toward peace, dignity, and cohesion. If it's just a matter of the HOA trying to mind your business or Westboro Baptist caring way too much about what strangers are doing and who they're doing it with, you can tell them to kick rocks. Moses wasn't concerned about the disruption he caused by taking the Israelites out of Egypt. Jesus didn't worry who he'd bother when he flipped the moneylenders\u2019 tables in the Tabernacle. You know why? Because following the rules and allowing those situations to continue violated the Sin more than stopping it.</p> <p>The Sin, and every commandment, generally boils down to those three things. Long as you're not committing the Sin, or as long as your committing it is less disruptive than it would be if you didn't step up, all the other commandments are fungible.</p> <p>Don't believe me? Look in Joshua 2:5-6, where Rahab lies to soldiers to protect Israelite spies in Jericho. Isn't lying a sin? But you just try and find me one word against Rahab in the whole Bible. Leviticus 24:9 says there's a certain bread in the Temple reserved for the priests, but David ate it in 1 Samuel 21:6, and in Matthew 12:3-5, Jesus says that and the desecration of the Sabbath don't matter, because of context. Whatever your thoughts on Biblical law, I'm pretty sure Jesus's opinion trumps yours. Rahab and David sinned, but they didn't commit the Sin, so they were in the clear, they upheld the spirit if not the letter.</p> <p>Numbers 21:8-9 states that Moses was ordered by God to make a bronze serpent to cure the Israelites of snakebite, which I'd say they pretty well deserved, since they were dumb enough to speak against God knowing full well how that was going to turn out, but God was willing to give them another chance to behave themselves. Flip forward now to 2 Kings 18:4, King Hezekiah smashes it up because it had become an idol, showing the tool itself wasn't good or bad, only how it was used, its involvement in the third form of the Sin was unacceptable. See it again in Matthew 19:24, it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter Heaven, but Solomon had gold like Scrooge McDuck and until his wives led him into the Sin, God had nothing bad to say about him. It's the pride, the arrogance, the second form of the Sin to be avoided, not anything on the outside. Jesus says it twice in the book of Matthew, straight up, in both 6:5 and 23:28, that it doesn't matter how outwardly pious someone is, it's only what's in their heart that matters, if they're committing the Sin it doesn't matter what else they're doing, they're sunk. Don't you think the inverse is true too? Jesus did, when he talked about David eating that bread.</p> <p>Want to see more? Genesis 11:1-9, God stopped the Tower of Babel in its tracks, but he sure didn't mind architecture in Exodus 31:1-6, when he gave several people the skills necessary to build a temple, showing he didn't punish the people of Babel for their actions, only their committing the Sin by building a monument to themselves. He hates pride, as seen for a long stretch of verses in Isaiah 47, and in 1 Corinthians 8:1-2. But he doesn't mind knowledge or ability or even divination, which is spoken against in several passages along with other witchcraft, and in fact God encourages those things in people who aren't otherwise sinful, as seen in Daniel 1:17-20, or Solomon's massive amount of knowledge seen in 1 Kings 4:33. God loves when good people advance, he only stops the progress of people committing the Sin.</p> <p>Oh, you wanted Islamic references? Well, should have said so earlier, I've got those. Check Sahih al-Bukhari Hadith 1, or Sahih Muslim number 1907, where the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, says actions are judged by intentions, not on their own merits. Check Surah al-Baqarah 2:173, Allah doesn't really, truly mind if you break some minor laws, you just probably shouldn't be eating roadkill if you can avoid it. As long as you aren't committing the Sin, you're probably in the clear. The purpose of the laws in Islam and Judaism, the ones that don't deal in harm to others or personal attitude, are to keep everyone healthy, happy, working well together, and bolstering each other's faith through outward expression. But you see now, the law isn't an absolute, as long as you don't get in the way of the true intention of it, your deity really doesn't care about you breaking it.</p> <p>Now, I know Matthew 5:17-19 says Jesus came not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it. I'm also aware of James 2:10, where anyone who stumbles at one part of the law breaks all of it. Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but you're going to have to read the whole page to know what they're talking about, trimming one sentence out of a speech doesn't impress me. If you can read a whole page of \u201cbe a good person\u201d and your takeaway is that one bit where they said \u201cfollow the law,\u201d and you think they're talking about Temple etiquette, you're beyond my help. What mental backflips do you have to turn to think James wants to put the Pharisee badge on for one verse, then take it off and continue his speech on being decent to people? That line is calling out people who obey the law but are still pricks, not saying you'll go to Hell for eating the wrong sandwich.</p> <p>To anyone else who thinks the letter of the law is still important after you've seen how willing God is to make exceptions, Jesus has a special message for you, and he was so worried you'd miss it, he said it about thirty different ways, in Matthew 23:23-24, Mark 2:27, Matthew 12:1-8, Matthew 15:3-9, Luke 11:46, and Matthew 9:13. If you can read all that and still think your job is to police the technicalities, then you\u2019re not following Christ, you're auditioning for the Pharisees. For the Jewish folks, check Hosea 6:6, Micah 6:8, Isaiah 1:11-17, Amos 5:21-24, Proverbs 21:3, Psalm 51:16-17, and Muslims, Qur\u2019an 2:177, Qur\u2019an 49:13, Qur\u2019an 5:8, Qur\u2019an 22:37, Sahih Bukhari 1, Sahih Muslim 2564. God doesn't care what you're doing, he cares about the effect on your community, and even then he only cares whether you meant it or not. Some things fall under a general prohibition because it'd be hard to do them without committing the Sin, generally in arrogance or harm to others, but if you can find a way to do them while keeping away from the Sin, he doesn't mind making an exception. You don't even need to ask permission or forgiveness, if you know you're not committing the Sin, God doesn't care about the technicalities. Can't promise the same of his followers, though.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#ii-divine-identity-crisis","title":"II: Divine Identity Crisis","text":"<p>If God is omnipresent, omnipotent, and hands-on, then what the hell is an Angel? Why would he create them? Why keep them around? What are they doing that he wasn't already fully capable of doing himself? Did he create lower beings for giggles? Course he didn't, God doesn't go off and do things just because he can. The answer is, Angels and God aren't separate beings, not really.</p> <p>If you've read the Bible, you know at least in the earliest stories, Angels pop up and start relaying a message from God, except they're saying all that in the first person. The text will get a little confused too, whether an Angel is speaking or God is. There's no failure of translation here, even in the original text, there's a very fuzzy line between Angels and God, and scholars have been tossing this question around pretty much since the Bible was written. It's not even that strange, if you're any Christian at all, you know the Nicene Creed. God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are fully three separate individuals, but also fully one. Okay, I lied, that is strange as all hell, but it's a strangeness you've already accepted, so I'm at least not bringing in any new strangeness. If you can understand that three individuals are those three individuals, but also one, you can understand a bigger number than three, even if accepting it would make Emperor Constantine call you a heretic.</p> <p>Want to see for yourself? Genesis 16:7-13, Genesis 22:12, Exodus 3, Judges 2:1-3, Judges 6:12-18, go ahead and read those, then try to tell me an Angel is a fully separate entity from God. God is the brain, Angels are the hands. In Islam, it's seen just that way, Angels are fully incapable of having their own opinions, they're just walking, talking Allah telephones. It seems pretty clear that the author of the Bible meant to convey the same idea here, they just didn't spell it out, because the nature of Angels really wasn't what they were trying to talk about here, that's not important from our perspective. But that Islamic view of Angels as just fancy robots isn't in the Quran. It's hinted at, and that's the dominant traditional view, but Scripturally, it's not put in terms that would allow no wiggle room, and there are plenty of Muslims who disagree.</p> <p>Let's put a pin in that for a second and talk about Buddhism. In the Mahayana school of thought, although the earlier Theravada school would disagree, it's seen that everything is one, just imagines itself separate, and the path to eternal happiness is to stop imagining that and rejoin the whole. Clearly this is the view of Angels, who, if they have free will, make the choice to stop being an individual and see themselves as one with God. The Hindu concept of Brahman and Atman is similar to the Buddhist beliefs. There, all things are one, Brahman, but they believe themselves separate, and they're so wrapped up in their individuality, Atman, that they straight up forget what they truly are. Hinduism doesn't emphasize rejoining the whole, they'd rather celebrate the individuality while acknowledging the underlying connection, but in basis, it's the same.</p> <p>And it's the same thing with God. The Trinity is one, the Angels are also part of the whole, but Jesus prayed to God any number of times in his life, and Satan, an angel, tempted Jesus to sin. These are clearly not just one guy running around wearing different masks, they are very much different entities, but we've also seen they're not, not really. Bet you didn't think you'd find out today that Christianity and Hinduism share a major core similarity, did you? The Nicene Creed is just a very limited form of Brahman, in function if not in tradition, and that \u201csame but separate\u201d unity isn't limited to the Trinity, based on those Bible verses where Angels speak as God. If this has you reconsidering the Nicene Creed now, check out John 8:58, John 10:30, John 14:9, John 17:21, it'd be a little bit of a stretch to try arguing Jesus is a separate entity from God, given how many times he said it.</p> <p>If you want to push it farther, my own personal theory is that Yahweh is the name of the band, not the lead singer. All spirits are interconnected, if they believe they're one, then they are, and I think that's exactly what happened when the Angels came together to form God. These guys don't even have names, they have jobs. If you've ever noticed all the Angel names end in -el or -iel, that's a clue, that suffix means \u201cof God,\u201d preceded by a noun, so these names are just job titles. Gabriel is \"strength of God,\" Raphael is \u201cmercy of God,\" Uriel means \"urine of God.\" Okay, I made that one up, but you get the point. When you call on Gabriel, you're not calling a guy, you're ringing up the Strength Department, please hold for the next available Angel.</p> <p>Does that theory change anything? Not really. God is God, whether he's an individual decision or a collective vote, it's all the same on our end. All I'm saying is the pieces fit. And personally, I find it a lot easier to believe this self-erasing group of deities acts as an individual than that they all decided to follow some guy who has an incredibly strong sense of Self and 613 strong opinions on your lunch order and your fashion sense.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#iii-separation-of-power","title":"III: Separation of Power","text":"<p>Cultures all over the world have had their Pantheons of gods, and outside of the Middle East, it was never the God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Why is that? Why would God only reveal his laws to such a small group of people, presumably leaving the rest to spend eternity in Hell through no fault of their own? That's not very loving or just. Well, the answer is, there's a difference between God and the power of God. Let's talk about Marzod.</p> <p>Logos to the Greeks, Brahman to the Hindi, Aether to most Western occultists, and Marzod in my writings, is the impersonal, primordial force that permeates everything. All the systems don't agree on the details, but there's a common thread running through them. It's the origin of the Universe, the energy everything else, every bit of matter or energy in the Universe, developed from. Marzod is the force harnessed by God to do what he does, and this force is all about harmony and balance, because when one being harms another, that's just Marzod hurting itself. Remember when we talked about the Sin, singular? It's the most important thing to God, the most important thing to the Hindi, it was the most important thing in nearly every religion everywhere, all through time.</p> <p>See, ancient man was easy. Marzod, not as an intelligence, but as a reactive system that exists outside of time, sees trouble coming from way upstream, so by the time humans start raising a fuss, a sky god shows up, a spirit that's been building his power for centuries, and he gets people's attention with a big damn storm. Then once they're listening, that sky god lays down a list of rules to stay on his good side, and wouldn't you know, all those rules have to do with keeping harmony and unity. Give that sky god about ten friends who also like harmony and unity, suddenly everyone around is living by Marzodian principles, and everything is peachy. Wouldn't work today, unfortunately. We're so convinced the supernatural is impossible, we could see a god with our own eyes doing impossible things, and we'd cry mass hallucination, special effects, flouride in the water, we'd stick our fingers in our ears, close our eyes, and hum real loud till the gods go away. And even if we were finally convinced, good luck convincing anyone who wasn't there.</p> <p>That's why Marzod stopped popping out gods left and right, it'd be completely ineffective. Sure, maybe you can convince a few people who can see, touch, hear, smell, and taste the whole thing, live and in person, but then you have to do that billions more times, and then repeat it in the next generation. Not that Marzod plans things out like that, it's just a reactive system, but so is evolution, and you'll see that when a new threat crops up, everything in that area goes through real, physical changes to deal with it. It can take hundreds or thousands of years, but that's where Marzod has a leg up: As a higher dimensional energy, time and space really aren't an issue, so the solution can crop up at exactly the same time as the problem, or even before it. Marzod wants balance, and it'll react to an imbalance. And it didn't stop, it only evolved. About 500 years ago the dominant, widest-traveling cultures of the world stopped being run by superstition quite so much, science started to slowly edge into the driver's seat, so instead of gods, Marzod had to form regular people who felt driven to a cause, who could fit in and affect the powers we respect most, our social institutions, our government, our money.</p> <p>So what does this mean for God? Well, God is one of those spirits that got power through Marzod. So does that mean he was lying, all those times in the Bible and Quran where he talked about being the beginning and end of everything? Absolutely not. Identifying himself as Marzod is a perfectly valid perspective, it's just not the ONLY perspective. Let's talk about spiritual links.</p> <p>When we talk about a spiritual link, we\u2019re saying two things have become one, so when a being linked to Marzod says he's the Alpha and Omega, it's quibbling over details to debate whether he means Marzod or his own unique personality that's linked to Marzod, it's like arguing which cells in your body are the oldest. That linked personality IS Marzod, as is every other linked personality, and they're all each other, too, in the same way your hand is still you. It's all one, and it'd just be stupid for the body to say the hand isn't a part of it. If you want Saint Paul's opinion on that, check 1 Corinthians 12:15-26. I hope I'm not spoiling it for you when I tell you he agrees with me.</p> <p>Course, that's not to say these deities were always the same. \u201cHarmony\u201d is a little bit of a nebulous concept to give ancient man as a law, the gods had to come up with laws to demonstrate what harmony might look like, and they all had slightly different ways of laying it down. They still had their own personalities, their own tendencies, and sometimes they'd get derailed. They'd stop being so much about order, start being more about conquest, or human sacrifice, or extreme punishments as some self-aggrandizing show of dominance. On that last one, I'm not naming any names, but I bet you Christian, Jewish, and Islamic readers know someone who did that at least a few times. But that's to be expected, it doesn't mean that any of these deities weren't generally good, wise, and just. They just weren't always, and some were less Marzodian than others.</p> <p>This is exactly how the Hindi see deities. Brahman pops them out as needed, because something is out of balance and has to be set right. Some are very kind and wise, some are the complete opposite, but the personality was picked by Brahman because that personality paired with power was going to resolve some issue. For a recent example on a related note, look to Manchester, England in the mid 1800s, when the industrial revolution was in full swing. Air pollution from factories darkened the bark of all the trees around, and all the light brown moths lost their camouflage, they didn't blend anymore, so they evolved to turn dark gray, making the Peppered Moth. It's not an intelligence or personality making a decision, it's a reactive, interconnected system whose goal is balance.</p> <p>So how about mythology? Do I believe Zeus came and tossed lightning bolts around every time he felt cranky, or that Joshua knocked down the walls of Jericho by blowing a horn? Do I believe Winter happens because Baldr kicked the bucket or Persephone went to the Underworld? Not really. Some of those things may have a historical root, and sure, genuine magic, gods, and miracles happen, but interaction with spirits and deities is a lot less concrete than these stories would have it, and there's never any telling where embellishments were added to improve the story. If you find knowledge and understanding in the Old Testament, or the teachings of the Buddha, or Aztec myths, I think that's great, I really do, but I doubt archaeologists or historians will back you up on it, and it was all written through the lens of the author's time, place, cultural attitudes, and life experience, which in ancient times generally was limited to events within the 30-mile radius of where he was born. None of it is absolute and incontrovertible, but nothing ever is, and that doesn't make it worthless.</p> <p>In the end, this idea doesn't weaken the God of Abraham. He's still the Universe's original force of creation, omniscient, omnipotent, he's still everything he ever was, because he's one with that force and indistinguishable from it. If anything, this idea strengthens him. All he cares about is order and balance, and lots of gods have been the same, in countless cultures around the world. And because they were all linked to Marzod, they were all different limbs on the same tree, different from each other, but working to the same goal. This idea reconciles the idea of an omnipotent creator with the God who, until a couple thousand years ago, limited his sphere of influence to a few tribes in the Middle Eastern desert. He's still Marzod, and he's not lying when he says he is, and from a certain perspective, his influence was worldwide since the beginning of human history, because harmony, balance, and order were the only real concerns of this God, and any other god of Marzod.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#iv-life-after-death","title":"IV: Life After Death","text":"<p>Let's talk a little about the afterlife, mostly in the Abrahamic sphere. We'll sort out what's actually promised in Scripture from what's only found in popular perception, and we'll explore other afterlives from other cultures to try to find common threads. If you like the idea of a city built in the clouds, this chapter probably isn't going to turn out the way you'd like, because once we've found those common threads, we'll compare them to what we know of Marzod as a scientifically explainable force, try to see what's really happening. The view here is that ancient people all over the world were using metaphor to explain a brief, confusing insight into something they didn't really have words for, and it was then edited and smoothed out by other people using the logic and ideas available at the time. It doesn't mean anyone lied. Like all supernatural interactions, it was an attempt to explain concepts that didn't exist yet, using words that weren't equal to the task.</p> <p>Bottom line, in the Bible, Heaven is described as a generally pleasant place, but there's very little detail given, unless you want to take John's divinely inspired acid trip in Revelation as fully literal. In the Quran, Heaven is described consistently as a garden, usually with rivers underneath and luxurious surroundings, all crystal and silver and silk. In the Bible's Hell, it's described fairly often as fire and destruction, and Matthew 25:41-46, Luke 16:23-24, Revelation 14:9-11, and Revelation 20:10 are usually interpreted as an eternal torture session, although of course there are fringe views that say otherwise. The Quran is also heavy on the fire here, so we've got agreement in the Abrahamic sphere. Separation from God ends in eternal fire.</p> <p>Going beyond the Abrahamic faiths, there's usually a divine judgement, then the souls are split up into groups based on how they lived their lives. The Norse had Valhalla, Hel, Hall of Ran, and a few others, while the Mesoamericans had the dead serving different gods after death, warriors becoming hummingbirds, mothers who died in childbirth becoming stars, 13 heavens and 9 underworlds. The Greco-Roman mythology had Hades, the Elysian Fields, a couple different torture rooms where the bad souls went. The Egyptians had the journey of the Ka across 12 underworlds to be judged by Horus. The Buddhists, depending on which school of thought you like, either want to stop existing entirely or just stop being themselves and instead be reunited with the One.</p> <p>So far, we've got consistency across cultures, that spirits go with their own kind based on their lives, and some of those are more pleasant than others, although the Abrahamic ones are fairly unique in their strict binary system. As for myself, I've been able to identify seven different types of spirit in my studies, which we covered in detail in the first section of this book:</p> <p>Marzod: Neutral, united, undifferentiated</p> <p>Water: Compassionate, impulsive, social, content</p> <p>Earth: Compassionate, structured, social, content</p> <p>Metal: Dispassionate, structured, solitary, content</p> <p>Air: Dispassionate, impulsive, solitary, ambitious</p> <p>Wood: Predatory, structured, social, ambitious</p> <p>Fire: Predatory, impulsive, solitary, ambitious</p> <p>That shows a clear chain of difference from Marzod, based on the major lines of division I could spot, with Fire being the least like Marzod, and helps explain why the God of Abraham keeps talking about casting incompatible souls into eternal flames. It's not prison, and it's not eternal torture, that'd be a little hard to reconcile with a kind, loving God aligned with the spirit of harmony, it's just \"you can't be here, your people are over there.\"</p> <p>See, a soul spends its whole life inside a body, but eventually, it loses that body, and the soul then only exists as higher dimensional energy. That's the only way it can exist, because even though there's extensive documentation across cultures on the soul, and they certainly didn't all get the idea from each other, this soul can't be perceived in any way we've ever tried. If it exists, it must be in the higher dimensions, which is something we'll cover more in the next book. This pervasive idea of the splitting up of souls shows me all souls start as Marzod, blank canvas, nothing, but with each action they take, they evolve. Spirits become incompatible with each other. Look at the Abrahamic faiths, Zoroastrianism, the Indian Asuras and Devas, some spirits can't stand being near each other, they're polar opposites.</p> <p>But the souls aren't locked away, every culture everywhere has seen them out and about. It's a little hard for them to interact with our dimensions, since they're stuck in theirs, but we've seen enough of them to know they're around, and as far as we can tell, life keeps right on going after the body's death. So, Heaven and Hell, they don't have rigid boundaries, there's likely a lot of middle ground. If you're not exactly Marzodian, that's okay. Just remember in the end, it's not going to be Horus having his monster eat you or God casting you into a fiery pit. You'll go over to the spirits you're most like, where you've chosen to be, so make sure you're comfortable with the company you'll be keeping. Eternity is a long damn time, and it's longer if you're stuck with a bunch of pricks.</p> <p>Still, you can always change, God himself started off being all about jealousy and wrath and literal fire, in the burning bush, the pillar of fire, his appearance on Mount Sinai, barbecuing Aaron's sons. But he changed, he matured into Water, became compassionate and loving, especially once Jesus came along. That's why Hell replaces the shadowy, neutral Sheol halfway through the Old Testament, it was always there, but now he's not compatible with those fiery spirits. I know you traditionalists are looking at the page now like I just tricked you into drinking sour milk, but if you're saying God is perfect and unchanging, then you're also saying he has no free will. A truly perfect being has no choice but to do the best thing in all situations, so any decision isn't really a question, and if you think God never changed over the course of the Bible, you should really go back and read it again, you've missed several key parts. In that view, being like God isn't being perfect, it's being wise enough to recognize when you're getting in your own way and being mature enough to admit you need to change. Those are qualities I'd admire in a divine entity, it makes him a lot better than most of them.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#part-three-hinduism","title":"Part Three: Hinduism","text":""},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#i-plants-are-people-too","title":"I: Plants Are People Too","text":"<p>I bet you thought the Hindi would get off easy, huh? I've talked a lot about the God of Abraham, and how his followers got the whole thing wrong and they should have been paying attention to what they're saying over in India. But I'm nothing if not even-handed, so let's talk about Hinduism, and where they might want to re-examine some things. First stop, vegetarianism. As with the Abrahamic faiths, I approach this with respect, and if you want to keep tradition on this, well, that's really up to you.</p> <p>Let's talk about plants first. As living things, they have spirits, and by what possible logic do you say one spirit is worth more than another? Because it has a face? Because it's cute and cuddly? Because it can move around more? Because its brain is centralized? You know those aren't good arguments, come on, is your respect for the sanctity of life, your ability to care about someone, really and truly based on how smart you think they are?</p> <p>In the view that ending the life of a living thing is not a good thing to do, killing a plant should logically be just as bad as killing an animal. Unfortunately, there is just no way to avoid killing things if you want to live in the world. Every single thing you will ever, have ever, or could ever eat for nourishment was once living, and had to be killed for your benefit. And then there's the rest of your life, how many plants and animals died in the construction of your house, the roads you travel on, the businesses that provide things you need to live in any measure of comfort? Every single moment of your life is built on the blood of plants and animals. Or, for plants, I guess it's sap, but anyway.</p> <p>So is this nihilism? Am I saying there's no point trying if you can't be 100%? Course not, that's a stupid, infantile, counterproductive attitude, and if any of you think that way, shame on you, I mean it. Every effort counts, and a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, to paraphrase an old Chinese saying attributed to various authors. I'm saying, if you can't help but kill living things to continue your life, you kill as few as possible. And that means eating meat.</p> <p>Counterintuitive, isn't it? But think about it. Meat has over double the calories per pound that plants do, on average, and let's not even get into how many plants go into those pounds, where with animals we're talking about pounds per animal. Even in the graded consciousness schools of thought, where there's a hierarchy of life forms, the incredible mass of lower life forms involved in a vegetarian diet must outweigh the value of the cute, cuddly little animal lives, right? Think about how many millions more life forms you'll kill in the course of a vegetarian life. Is it really balancing out in your favor, Karmically speaking?</p> <p>But, I know, climate change. Raising livestock is a big contributor, and I won't deny it, it's pretty egregious. But the problem isn't the livestock, it's how it's being raised, it's the corporate overlords raising these animals in misery and suffering, with no regard for the planet they're destroying in the process. Refusing to buy from them is using your single vote to say you don't approve, but you know what's even better? Supporting their competition, the small, non-corporate, ethical ranchers with sustainable practices. The little guys bleed the big one, and the longer they stick around, the more blood they take. Keeping them in business is much more harmful to the corporate pricks than a full boycott of meat, use your vote to do that instead.</p> <p>But isn't a vegetarian diet healthier? Not one bit. Overconsumption of meat is bad, sure, but not consuming it at all? I tried to go vegetarian once, not for health or moral reasons, but financial ones, and let me tell you, without meat malnutrition is a beast. It's almost impossible to balance your diet correctly with no meat, because guess what, we evolved to eat meat from time to time, that's why our ancestors used to chase mammoths around with pointy sticks, it wasn't just good exercise, they actually needed it. You CAN make it work, but getting all the vitamins, minerals, and calories you need is real, constant work. And as we've explored, it's really not helping your Karmic standing, so how about you just make the whole thing easier and more Karmically aligned, and put some meat in your diet?</p> <p>Look, end of the day, both sides can be defended on practical, moral, and ethical grounds, and the strengths and weaknesses of either will mostly come down to how, not what. If the answer was definitive, nobody would still be asking the question. Nobody's doing what they do for stupidity or evil, or at least, those kind are very much in the minority. All I can tell you is how I see it, and if you don't like it, you're free to eat all the plants you want.</p>"},{"location":"books/the_book-of-water/#ii-reincarnation-re-examined","title":"II: Reincarnation Re-examined","text":"<p>I want to start this off by telling a story. There was one stretch of time where my dad thought my sister and I weren't grateful enough for things. Now, we could talk all day about the merits and fallacies of that outlook, how much of the problem was in us versus in him, but we'll skip that for now, and just say he wasn't entirely off base. He decided he'd teach us a lesson and stop cooking meals, stop buying things at the grocery store, let us live off what was in the cupboards till we cracked, and his brilliant masterstroke here was he wouldn't tell us it was happening. He'd let us realize all on our own how much he was doing for us, and we'd come to him apologetically, contrition in our hearts.</p> <p>Apparently this went on for a couple weeks, and I say \"apparently\" because I never once noticed. Neither did my sister, to the best of my knowledge, we were just fine living like that. He finally had to crack, he told us what he'd been doing so that it could be over with and he could go to the grocery store and start making real meals again. I don't know what response he was looking for in that moment, but it definitely wasn't for me to find the situation funny, which I did. And I told you all that to tell you this: if the target of a punishment doesn't notice, it might as well not have happened.</p> <p>That's the problem with reincarnation, isn't it? A worm's life isn't punishment to a worm. He's not sitting in his hole moping about having no hands, wishing he didn't live in wet dirt, he likes it, he's having a great time. Every day is a new adventure, new and exciting dirt to eat, hell, that worm is probably happier than any of us, because he has no frame of reference. His life only sucks in contrast to ours, but he doesn't know about ours. If he used to be a person, but sucked so bad at it he got downgraded to worm, who cares? He doesn't remember all that, can't possibly imagine it, and he's not upset about it one bit.</p> <p>It's not just worms, either. I bet dogs sit around telling each other \"be a good boy, don't chew up any shoes, or in your next life you'll spend half your life at work just so you can be allowed to live, and you'll have a midlife crisis and question the meaning of existence and die without ever feeling fulfilled.\" If I was a dog and somebody told me that, it it'd scare the hell out of me, I'd never even look sideways at another shoe. Where's the internal logic of this idea of reincarnation? Humanity is seen as being near the pinnacle, but if that's the case, I need to go rack up some negative Karma so I can make sure I get something better in my next life.</p> <p>Humans like to believe in justice. Bad things happen to bad people, good things happen to good people, and because we can see that's not real, we think it must happen after death. Well, there's no hard logic here, and even so, I'd accept reincarnation if there were cultural consensus, but it strikes out there too. I accept the afterlife, because cultures that never even heard of each other all believe it, and I can pull common threads to combine with science and figure something out about it. But no culture outside of India and its sphere of influence believes in reincarnation, and with no compelling logic to it, it's not something I'm going to buy.</p> <p>In the end, it seems like wishful thinking. Bad things happen to bad people, good things happen to good people, and there's a good reason to be good, even if being bad gets you places in life. And even as wishful thinking, it doesn't work. Whether my next life is a dog or an eagle, I won't know the difference. And really, if that next life has none of my memories, is it even really me? If I die, and someone's born on the other side of the world with none of my memories, thoughts, or feelings, how can that be me?</p> <p>If you know about the Ship of Theseus, you know what I'm talking about. If you don't, Theseus was a figure of Greek mythology, a prince of Athens who, understandably, raised objections to the fact that every nine years, the city of Athens had to send seven of its young men and seven young women to Crete to be eaten by a Minotaur who lived in a maze. Well, I'm sure I'm not spoiling the story too much when I say he killed the Minotaur, found his way out of the maze, and returned to Athens, where the ship was kept in a museum for generations. But where it was kept, they had it floating in a pool of water, and naturally it would rot, and different parts were replaced over time. In the end, not one piece of the original ship was still there, so was it really the Ship of Theseus? Bringing it full circle, if not one part of me survives in the new person, is that person me?</p> <p>That being said, just because reincarnation probably isn't real doesn't mean Karma's not. If you're a selfish, backstabbing prick, it doesn't matter how many material rewards you have, you'll have no community and no real friends, while a generosity of spirit will lead to strong social ties. That's what matters in the end, ask any workaholic on their deathbed whether they wish they'd spent more time getting stuff or being with their friends and family. And if you like the idea of reincarnation, that's just fine. If it brings you peace, if it explains the world in a way that makes sense to you, I can't tell you it definitely doesn't exist. And since it makes no practical difference, you go on and believe it, nobody can tell you you're wrong for sure.</p>"},{"location":"books/Statement_of_Purpose/Statement%20of%20Purpose/","title":"Statement of Purpose","text":"<p>[[toc]]</p> <p>Our sacred charge is the tireless pursuit of Knowledge in all its manifold and wondrous forms, and above all, the earnest seeking of understanding concerning the great Mysteries of the Universe.

Whilst secrecy is oft esteemed among societies of like kind, the Order layeth no such yoke upon its members in general, for our holy purpose is the illumination of the world, yet in matters wherein the sacred function of the Order might be undone, secrecy shall be paramount. Such compromised knowledge shall be reckoned as that which pertaineth unto the Marzodian Runes, any weaknesses which may be found in the security or process of the Order, or any knowledge which transgresseth the Prime Law, for as knowledge may bring harm unto others, secrecy is oft enforced indirectly through the Prime Law.</p> <p>The Third Law is as thus: That the Chief Keeper shall be sovereign over his Collective, and answerable only unto the Marzodian Council, under circumstances named hereafter. Let the Council make no law that bindeth a Collective in its particular affairs, but only such decrees as are most necessary and most widely applicable unto the public good.

Should one fit to serve choose not to do so, the mantle of leadership shall pass to the next in succession. A seat upon the Council may not be revoked, save by death, voluntary resignation, or by the will of the other two members. In all matters brought before the Council, the decision of the majority shall prevail, and such a ruling may not be revisited for one year, save by the Council\u2019s own unanimous decree. A gathering of the Council shall be called upon the following occasions to render a decision, and no decree thus made may be reversed except by the formal declaration of no less than nine tenths of all Chief Keepers, or unanimous decree of the Council.</p> <p>1.1. Of Specialties and Refinements A Specialty is attained through the submission of a treatise, composed by a Keeper, containing no fewer than seven pages on a singular subject. Acceptable subject matter shall generally encompass fields such as physics, chemistry, alchemy, mathematics, natural history, psychology, mythology, religion, ancient cultures, philosophy, mysticism or the occult, and other matters which advance knowledge of the nature of the universe or ancient peoples, from whom much insight into mysterious forces may be gleaned. This treatise shall be presented before the Council, who shall judge it according to its merit in truth, insight, and distinction from the Keeper's other Specialties, which is to say, whether it sufficiently broadens the Keeper's knowledge to merit further accreditation. Should the work fail in this last, but otherwise be of good quality, it shall be considered a Refinement of a Specialty, or a deepening of existing knowledge. By their judgment, the Council may approve or reject such a work.</p> <p>1.2. Of Collectives A Collective is the local manifestation of the Order, a sanctuary of knowledge, a place of learning for its students, and a gathering ground for its members. It is incumbent upon all members of the Order to be attached to a Collective, most often the one nearest their home, though this is not of necessity. Service to the Collective is commanded by the Chief Keeper and is the shared duty of all its members. Should a Keeper desire to head a Collective, they may do so by decree of the Council, dedicating their time to the recruitment and instruction of students. If any Keeper desires to found a Collective, or lay claim to one established, let the matter be presented to the Council, who shall bestow the position upon the Keeper most suited, choosing by the number of Specialties and Refinements they possess and the greatest need among the regions of the Earth. Yet, as with the Council itself, no Keeper is bound to accept such a charge, but may refuse it if they so wish.</p> <p>1.3. Of Corruption or Inaptitude Should any member bring accusation of corruption or inaptitude against a Chief Keeper, the matter shall be presented to the Council, who shall convene to give it due consideration.</p> <ol> <li>Chief Keeper As the sovereign of their Collective, a Chief Keeper may in all things follow their own counsel and govern the Collective according to their wisdom, provided they do not transgress the Prime nor Secondary Laws. Nevertheless, if a Chief Keeper is unable or disinclined to resolve a matter, let him bring the matter before the Council for their judgment.</li> <li>Keeper</li> </ol> <p>Any Seeker, upon the acquisition of a Specialty, ascends to the station of Keeper, thereby gaining sufficient stature to guide a Collective or serve as an Overseer. Additional Specialties and Refinements may be obtained, augmenting and enhancing their station, advancing their standing in appointment to Chief Keeper or to the Council.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Seeker A Seeker is numbered among the Order, although not yet of such stature as may permit them into positions of leadership, which are generally reserved for the Keepers, though a Chief Keeper may assign certain duties to Seekers should no qualified Keeper be found to accept the role.</p> </li> <li> <p>Disciple A Disciple is one who has attained an advanced stage of study, in which they may begin to bear minor responsibilities of membership and perform in sacred rituals involving human spirits and deities.</p> </li> <li> <p>Initiate An Initiate is one who has but commenced the journey of knowledge, and is constrained to performance in rituals involving the spirits of Nature and the Elements.</p> </li> <li> <p>Novice A Novice is one who possesses the fervent desire to tread the path of knowledge. There exists no particular requirement to attain this rank, save for the earnest wish to learn and the judgment of a Chief Keeper that the individual may bring credit and honor to the Order. Novices may not perform in rituals, but devote themselves to study of the foundational tenets of the Order and understanding of the Mysteries of the Universe.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Trials of Ascension</p> <p>The Trials of Ascension are the means by which one may ascend in station. They may be administered by any Keeper, who, upon a student's request, is bound to honor it within seven days, or else seek another Keeper to act in their stead. The full procedure is set forth below.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Of Overseers Overseers shall hold no station lower than that of Keeper, and it is their charge to conduct the Trials. An Overseer shall adhere scrupulously to all established forms of the Trials, and the word of the Overseer shall be deemed absolute, save in cases as specified in the following section, or by order of the Council.</p> </li> <li> <p>Of Special Permissions In the ensuing requirements, the Aspirant is invited to exercise their own judgement in the choosing of many of the particulars. In such matters, the Overseer may exercise their discretion regarding the validity of the Aspirant's choices, but must yield to any prior permissions granted by a Keeper. The Keeper or Keepers of import, at the time of the Trials, must readily answer the Overseer's inquiries, and, should their prior approval of the Aspirant's methods and selections be affirmed, the matter shall be considered settled, and the method or choice in question deemed valid. Nevertheless, all restrictions of the Trials shall remain in place, and may not be countermanded, save by decree of the Council. Should corruption or inaptitude on the part of a Keeper in such matters be suspected by the Overseer, the matter shall not be examined within the Trial, but must be presented to the Chief of the Keeper's Collective or to the Council.</p> </li> <li> <p>Of Marzodian Runes</p> </li> </ol> <p>Fluency in the Runes is expected of all Seekers, and all material in attainment of the station of Keeper and any further Specialties or Refinements must be executed by hand using the Runes. The mysteries of the Runes are not to be revealed to any below the rank of Seeker, on pain of expulsion from the Order.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Of Journaling The Aspirant shall keep a faithful journal, summarizing their knowledge. As a guide, every square inch of paper should bear two to three words. The journal is intended to serve as summary and aid to memory, rather than a detailed exposition. Therefore, it is advised to limit each subject to two hundred fifty words, occupying a single side of the majority of paper types, with an absolute constraint of five hundred words on any single subject counted toward the total. Each advancement of station shall impose a requisite page count, understood as a collection of five hundred words, and thus may be adjusted by the Overseer to more precisely reflect the number of words expected. The tally of pages shall encompass both old and new, with seven new pages prescribed for every rank.</p> </li> <li> <p>Of Rituals A ritual is to be understood as any spellwork, potion, invocation, or similar endeavor, involving multiple participants and overseen or led by one of worthy qualification. The Aspirant must, by the discerning judgment of the ritual's leader, acquit themselves with skill in all tasks for which their station may be expected to have prepared them. The tally of rituals for each rank must not incorporate those in which the Aspirant has partaken for prior ranks, and shall consist solely of rituals befitting the Aspirant's current station.</p> </li> <li> <p>Of Treatises Treatises shall be composed prior to the Trials. There are no requirements concerning the number of words used, provided that the main particulars are clearly discerned and adequately explored, and the materials examined must be distinct from those of prior Trials. 6A. Of Mythology: A treatise dealing in mythology shall comprise a summary of two myths of dissimilar cultures, preferably predating any contact between them. The myths shall be of similar substance, and their similarities and differences fully explored within the treatise.</p> </li> <li> <p>Of Writings Writings are composed by the sole aid of memory, in the presence of the Overseer. Corrections are permitted, provided the final result is legible, and a time limit shall not be imposed unless specifically declared in the instructions. In recounting the particulars of rituals, it is perfectly acceptable for the rituals described and engaged in to share commonality, the only requirement being that the steps must be correctly defined and the true reason for these steps discerned. As with Treatises, the materials presented must not emulate those in prior Trials.</p> </li> </ol> <p>7A. Of Letter and Reply The Overseer shall compose a letter to the Aspirant, consisting of approximately seven hundred words regarding their standing and accomplishments since the most recent Trials, which the Aspirant shall read aloud.

Should one fit to serve choose not to do so, the mantle of leadership shall pass to the next in succession. A seat upon the Council may not be revoked, save by death, voluntary resignation, or by the will of the other two members. In all matters brought before the Council, the decision of the majority shall prevail, and such a ruling may not be revisited for the period of one year, save by the Council\u2019s own unanimous decree. A gathering of the Council shall be called upon the following occasions to render a decision, and no decree thus made may be reversed within the states period of one year, except by the formal declaration of no less than nine tenths of all Chief Keepers, or unanimous decree of the Council.</p> <p>1.1. Specialties and Refinements</p> <p>A Specialty is attained through the submission of a treatise, composed by a Keeper, containing no fewer than seven pages on a singular subject. Acceptable subject matter shall generally encompass fields such as physics, chemistry, alchemy, mathematics, natural history, psychology, mythology, religion, ancient cultures, philosophy, mysticism or the occult, and other matters which advance knowledge of the nature of the universe or ancient peoples, from whom much insight into mysterious forces may be gleaned. This treatise shall be presented before the Council, who shall judge it according to its merit in truth, insight, and distinction from the Keeper's other Specialties, which is to say, whether it sufficiently broadens the Keeper's knowledge to merit further accreditation. Should the work fail in this last, but otherwise be of good quality, it shall be considered a Refinement of a Specialty, or a deepening of existing knowledge. By their judgment, the Council may approve or reject such a work.</p> <p>1.2. Collectives</p> <p>A Collective is the local manifestation of the Order, a sanctuary of knowledge, a place of learning for its students, and a gathering ground for its members. It is incumbent upon all members of the Order to be attached to a Collective, most often the one nearest their home, though this is not of necessity. Service to the Collective is commanded by the Chief Keeper and is the shared duty of all its members. Should a Keeper desire to head a Collective, they may do so by decree of the Council, dedicating their time to the recruitment and instruction of students. If any Keeper desires to found a Collective, or lay claim to one established, let the matter be presented to the Council, who shall bestow the position upon the Keeper most suited, choosing by the number of Specialties and Refinements they possess and the greatest need among the regions of the Earth. Yet, as with the Council itself, no Keeper is bound to accept such a charge, but may refuse it if they so wish.</p> <p>1C. Corruption or Inaptitude</p> <p>Should any member bring accusation of corruption or inaptitude against a Chief Keeper, the matter shall be presented to the Council, who shall convene to give it due consideration. Should such a charge concern a member of the Council, the final decision shall abide in the hands of the other two members.</p> <ol> <li>Chief Keeper</li> </ol> <p>As the sovereign of their Collective, a Chief Keeper may in all things follow their own counsel and govern the Collective according to their wisdom, provided they do not transgress the Prime nor Secondary Laws.

They may be administered by any Keeper, who, upon a student's request, is bound to honor it within seven days, or else seek another Keeper to act in their stead. The results of a Trial must be presented to the Council within seven days of completion. The full procedure of the Trials is set forth below.</p> <ol> <li>Overseers</li> </ol> <p>Overseers shall hold no station lower than that of Keeper, and it is their charge to conduct the Trials. An Overseer shall adhere scrupulously to all established forms of the Trials, and the word of the Overseer shall be deemed absolute, save in cases as specified in the following section, or by order of the Council.</p> <ol> <li>Special Permissions</li> </ol> <p>In the ensuing requirements, the Aspirant is invited to exercise their own judgement in the choosing of many of the particulars. In such matters, the Overseer may exercise their discretion regarding the validity of the Aspirant's choices, but must yield to any prior permissions granted by any Keeper. The Keeper or Keepers of import, at the time of the Trials, must readily answer the Overseer's inquiries, and, should their prior approval of the Aspirant's methods and selections be affirmed, the matter shall be considered settled, and the method or choice in question deemed valid. Nevertheless, all restrictions of the Trials shall remain in place, and may not be countermanded, save by decree of the Council. Should corruption or inaptitude on the part of a Keeper in such matters be suspected by the Overseer, the matter shall not be examined within the Trial, but must be presented to the Council. The results of the Trial may then be considered, and the Aspirant allowed to repeat or revise any portion found to be illegitimate.</p> <ol> <li>Marzodian Runes</li> </ol> <p>Fluency in the Runes is expected of all Seekers, and all material in attainment of the station of Keeper and any further Specialties or Refinements must be executed by hand using the Runes. The mysteries of the Runes are not to be revealed to any below the rank of Seeker, on pain of expulsion from the Order.</p> <ol> <li>Journaling</li> </ol> <p>The Aspirant shall keep a faithful journal, summarizing their knowledge. As a guide, every square inch of paper should bear two to three words. The journal is intended to serve as summary and aid to memory, rather than a detailed exposition. Therefore, it is advised to limit each subject to two hundred fifty words, occupying a single side of the majority of paper types, with an absolute constraint of five hundred words on any single subject counted toward the total. Each advancement of station shall impose a requisite page count, understood as a collection of five hundred words, and thus may be adjusted by the Overseer to more precisely reflect the number of words expected. The tally of pages shall encompass both old and new, with seven new pages prescribed for every rank.</p> <ol> <li>Rituals</li> </ol> <p>A ritual is to be understood as any spellwork, potion, invocation, or similar endeavor, monitored or led by one of worthy qualification. While success or failure of the ritual is immaterial, that condition being in many cases beyond the control of the Practitioner, the Aspirant must, by the discerning judgment of the ritual's leader or monitor, acquit themselves with skill in all tasks for which their station may be expected to have prepared them. The tally of rituals for each rank must not incorporate those in which the Aspirant has partaken for prior ranks, and shall consist solely of rituals befitting the Aspirant's current station.</p> <ol> <li>Treatises</li> </ol> <p>Treatises shall be composed prior to the Trials. There are no requirements concerning the number of words used, provided that the main particulars are clearly discerned and adequately explored, and the materials examined must be distinct from those of prior Trials.</p> <p>6A. Analysis of Mythology</p> <p>A treatise dealing in analysis of mythology shall comprise a summary of a myth from any ancient culture, separating embellishments from facts, and finding what may be historical roots within.</p> <ol> <li>Writings</li> </ol> <p>Writings are composed by the sole aid of memory, in the presence of the Overseer. Corrections are permitted, provided the final result is legible, and a time limit shall not be imposed, save that it remains within reasonable limits. In recounting the particulars of rituals, it is perfectly acceptable for the rituals described and engaged in to share commonality, the only requirement being that the steps must be correctly defined and the true reasons for these steps discerned. As with Treatises, the materials presented must not emulate those in prior Trials.</p> <p>7A. Letter and Reply</p> <p>The Overseer shall compose a letter to the Aspirant, consisting of approximately seven hundred words regarding their standing and accomplishments since the most recent Trials, which the Aspirant shall read aloud. Afterward, the Aspirant shall compose a reply of no less than seventy words.</p> <p>7B. Languages</p> <p>The Aspirant must select a tongue of notable historical roots and compose a Writing concerning the alphabet of the language, naming all characters. It is unnecessary that the language itself be learned, only the writing system. Using this system, the Aspirant shall write the names of the deities attached to the planets and their metals in order of hierarchy, then the Circles of Nurture and Control and the Orders of Creation, Alignment, Path, and Numerology. The most common approved languages include Latin, Ancient Hebrew, Ancient Greek, Egyptian Demotic, Arabic, Elder Futhark, and Mayan hieroglyphs, though any language of similar age and standing may be employed. The language selected must not have been used in prior Trials.</p>"}]}
